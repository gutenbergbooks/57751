<span class="subhead"><i>THE EXCITEMENT OF A PHENOMENAL STRUGGLE
TOOK HIM TO THE VERGE OF DISHONOR</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Five men of better nerve never dealt
cards than the five who sat playing poker
the other night in one of those up-town
club-rooms that are so quietly kept as to be
entirely unknown to the police and the general
public. The game proved to be phenomenal.</p>

<p>The play was high. The party had played
together once a week, for a long time, and
the limit had always been one dollar at the
beginning of the evening, though occasionally
it had gone as high as ten before morning.
This particular night, however, the
cards ran remarkably well, and by midnight
the limit was ignored if not forgotten. Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
of the players had laid their pocketbooks
alongside their chips. They had not played
so before, but the gambling fever had come
upon them with the excitement of good
hands, one against another, until the friendly
contest had become a struggle for blood.
Fours had been shown several times since
midnight, and beaten once, while straight
flushes had twice won important money.
Deck after deck had been called for, and
tossed aside in turn after a few deals, till
the carpet was strewn thickly with the discarded
pasteboards, but there was no change
in the remarkable run of the cards. Pat
fulls and flushes showed in deal after deal,
and the luck in the draw was so extraordinary
and so evenly distributed that they all
grew cautious of betting on any ordinary
hand, and a bluff had not been tried for an
hour. Yet no one had offered a remark,
though the play grew higher and harder.
It was as if each man feared to break the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
run by mentioning it. At length the Colonel
spoke.</p>

<p>“The devil himself is playing with his
picture books to-night, I think,” he said,
with a short laugh, as he lost two stacks of
blues on a seven full.</p>

<p>It had been the Doctor’s deal, and he
looked up quickly. Gazing at the Colonel,
he said:</p>

<p>“The hands are certainly remarkable. I
never saw so many big ones at one sitting.”
The words were simple, but there was a
curious tone, half of question, in his voice.
There had not been such nervous tension in
the party before, but they were all men of
experience, and had seen trouble between
friends resulting from careless words on
many different occasions.</p>

<p>The Colonel detected the tone and answered
quickly and gracefully:</p>

<p>“That’s so, Doc. I’ve beaten some
strong hands myself to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
“A new pack, Sam,” said the Editor,
who was the next to deal. The imperturbable
darky by the sideboard produced one
instantly, and the Editor shuffled it carefully.
Then he offered it to the other players
in turn. They all refused to touch it,
and, shuffling the deck himself once more,
he laid it down for the cut and began to
deal. It was a little thing, but so far out
of the ordinary as to mark the fact that they
were fencing now with bare blades, and
from that on, there was a strict observance
of the punctilio of the game.</p>

<p>One by one the cards fell in five symmetrical
little piles, as perfect as Herrmann
could have made them, for the Editor was
deft with his fingers, but one after another
of the players passed out and a jack pot was
made. The big hands had failed to appear.</p>

<p>It was the Congressman’s deal, and he
doubled his ante and took the cards. The
Colonel sat next and pushed out four blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
chips—twenty dollars. The others all came
in, the Congressman making good and dealing
without a word. There was a hundred
dollars in the pot, and there came that curious
certainty to all of them which sometimes
comes to experienced players, that a
mighty struggle was at hand.</p>

<p>The Colonel made a pretense of looking
at his hand, but in reality looked only at
the first two cards. They were both aces.
He passed.</p>

<p>The Lawyer sat next. He found a four
flush and a pair of tens; so he passed.</p>

<p>The Doctor was next player. He held a
pat straight, king high. He opened the
pot for twenty dollars.</p>

<p>The Editor came in on three deuces, and
the Congressman with a pair of queens
put up his money. The others came up
promptly.</p>

<p>The Colonel, having first call, looked
over his hand carefully. The last card was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
an ace also, and he called for one, holding
up a seven. The four hearts in the Lawyer’s
hand were the queen, ten, nine, and
eight. He promptly discarded the other
ten, and drew one card. The Doctor, of
course, stood pat, and the Editor drew two.
The Congressman also drew to the strength
of his hand.</p>

<p>With all the players in, the Doctor felt
that a straight was a doubtful hand, but he
put up twenty and waited. The Editor
looked anxiously for the fourth deuce, but,
finding neither that nor a pair, laid down
his cards.</p>

<p>Three sixes had fallen to the Congressman’s
queens, and he raised it twenty.
Thereupon they all looked keenly at the
Colonel. Not a muscle moved in his stern,
handsome face, as he saw the raise, and
went fifty better.</p>

<p>It was ninety dollars for the Lawyer to
come in. He simply made good, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
looked anxiously to see if there would be
another raise. They criticised his play
afterward, claiming that he should have
raised back, but he defended it by saying
that there were two players yet to hear from.
The first of these resigned. A king straight
was no hand for that struggle. The Congressman
was still confident of his full hand,
however, for he had drawn three sixes, and he
came back at the Colonel with fifty more.</p>

<p>The Colonel raised him a hundred. It
looked as if it would be a duel between him
and the Congressman, but the Lawyer was
still to hear from. He raised it a hundred.
The Congressman made good, and the Colonel
raised again.</p>

<p>The Lawyer counted his chips carefully,
and finding exactly the right amount, covered
the last raise. Then, opening his
pocketbook, he drew out a hundred-dollar
bill and pushed that to the middle of the
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Once more the Congressman made good,
and the Colonel raised it a hundred. The
Lawyer came back, and the Congressman
dropped out.</p>

<p>The Colonel raised it a hundred. The
Lawyer made it another, and there was over
twenty-five hundred dollars on the table.</p>

<p>The struggle of the evening had come,
and the three who had dropped out were not
less excited than the two players. To all
appearance they were far more so, for the
Colonel looked as calm as if on parade, and
the Lawyer’s only sign of agitation was his
heightened color. None of them thought
much of that, for he was of plethoric habit
and flushed easily.</p>

<p>The Colonel raised it a hundred. The
Lawyer fumbled in his pocketbook for a
moment, and, drawing out a fresh roll of
bills, raised it two hundred. The Colonel
raised it five hundred. The Lawyer came
back at him with five hundred more. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Colonel raised it a thousand. The Lawyer
flipped up the ends of the bills he was holding
in his hand, and, counting them rapidly,
found a little over two thousand dollars.
Separating the odd money, he extended his
hand with the twenty centuries in it, and
was in the act of speaking, when he checked
himself as suddenly as if he had been shot.</p>

<p>“I raise—” he began, and then was
stricken dumb. The bills were still in his
grasp, and, instead of laying them down, he
sat for a moment as rigid as a statue, while
his face grew white.</p>

<p>The silence was intense. The Colonel
was the only one in the party who showed
no excitement, but the Lawyer, who had
watched him up to that moment with the
most acute scrutiny, no longer looked at
him at all. Instead, he slowly withdrew
his hand, picked up his cards, which he had
laid, face down, before him, and looked
them over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
“What is that for?” thought the Editor.
“He is not looking to see what he
holds. He knows perfectly well. And he
hasn’t been bluffing. What stopped him, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>No one spoke, however, as the Lawyer
laid his cards down again and looked once
more into his pocketbook.</p>

<p>“Aha!” thought the Editor. “It’s the
amount that staggers him. That’s queer,
too. I’ve seen him play higher than this at
the tables.”</p>

<p>It seemed to be the amount, however; for
the Lawyer, finding no more money in his
pocketbook, counted out a thousand dollars
from the roll in his hand and, laying that
on the pile in the middle of the table, said:</p>

<p>“I call you.”</p>

<p>His hand shook perceptibly, and for the
first time the Colonel’s face relaxed. He
smiled grimly as he laid down four aces.</p>

<p>The Lawyer’s face had been pale, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
grew almost ghastly as he showed his hand.
He had caught the jack of hearts in the
draw and had won the pot.</p>

<p>The Doctor watched him curiously, even
more so than the others, though the entire
party was surprised. To his professional
eye it looked as if the excitement would
culminate in a fainting fit. That for a moment
was indeed imminent; then the magnificent
nerve which had made the Lawyer
famous stood him in good stead, and he rallied
by a supreme effort. Once more his
hand was as steady as clockwork as he
reached out and drew the great pile of chips
and gold and bank bills toward him.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until after he had
done a strange thing that he could command
himself sufficiently to speak. And
while he was doing it the others looked on
in silence. They had seen four aces beaten
by a straight flush, but even the excitement
of that was in abeyance. Some strange climax<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
was coming, and none could even guess
what it would be.</p>

<p>First he counted out from the pile twenty
one-hundred-dollar bills, and, folding them
together with the money he had held back
on the last bet, he placed the roll in his
pocketbook, and, closing that carefully, put
it into his inside pocket and drew a long
breath—almost a gasp—as if of relief.
Next he counted out two thousand more and
pushed it over toward the Colonel, who
looked at it and at him in wonder. The remainder
of the pot—a goodly sum—lay in a
confused heap in front of him, and before
speaking he looked at it steadily for a space
wherein one might count fifty. At length
he said, raising his hand, as if registering
an oath:</p>

<p>“I am done with poker. I have nothing
to say against the game. You all know how
well I love to play. To my mind there is
no other sport that equals it. None, I believe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
so shows the skill and the mettle of
a man as this does. Yet, loving the game
as well and admiring it as much as I do,
I give it up from this moment, forever. I
have stepped across the border line of dishonor
to-night. The money I have just put
back in my pocket was given to me last
evening by a client to be paid out this
morning, and if I had lost I could not
immediately have replaced it. I had it in
my possession simply because I had not had
the opportunity to deposit it, and in the
excitement of the game I forgot that it was
not my own. The fascination that could
make me do a thing like that is one that I
dare not risk again. Then, as the last two
thousand I bet was not my own, I cannot
touch the money I won with it. I have returned
it to the Colonel, and, as you, sir,
would never have betted against dishonest
money, it is as if it had never been at stake,
and consequently it is yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
The Colonel bowed and picked up the
bills.</p>

<p>“As to the rest of this,” continued the
Lawyer, pointing to the pile which he had
not yet disturbed, “I am in doubt. I certainly
won it, but I am embarrassed at quitting
a friendly game with such heavy winnings.
It is not a question of right, but of
delicacy, and I prefer to put it to you, as to
a jury, whether I owe you satisfaction in any
way.”</p>

<p>He paused, and still no other man spoke.
It was as if each one was waiting for the
others. So the Lawyer spoke again.</p>

<p>“What am I to do?” he said. “I am
in the hands of my friends.”</p>

<p>They all looked at the Colonel. He was
the oldest in the party.</p>

<p>“I am no man’s censor,” said he, seeing
that he was expected to speak. “Neither
do I care to consider the morals of the question,
but I have seen a man blow his brains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
out over a card table after he had done what
you have done, and lost, as you, fortunately,
did not. I said then that he did well, and
I say now that you have done well. Having
won with money that was not your own, even
though you did it inadvertently, you could
not touch your winnings. But as to that
which you won with your own money—Are
you very sure that you will never play
again?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” said the Lawyer.</p>

<p>“Then pocket your money. We have
played together, we five, for more than a
year now, and I doubt if you are much
ahead of the game, even counting your winnings
to-night.”</p>

<p>He extended his hand, and the Lawyer
grasped it nervously. One after another,
the three others shook hands with him also,
and the game was over.</p>

</div>

<p>“No, I don’t play poker any more,” said
a big Westerner, who came into an up-town
club-house the other night with some friends
who had been showing him the town. He
spoke rather seriously, although he had been
chatting and laughing in a loud, breezy way
until the very moment when somebody suggested
a little game of draw as an appropriate
wind-up of the night’s diversion.</p>

<p>“Why, how is that?” exclaimed one of
his friends. “You used to play a stiff
game. You haven’t sworn off, have you?”</p>

<p>“N-no,” said the Westerner, still serious.
“I have not sworn off, but there is
no excitement in the game for me now.
The last game I played was too exciting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
“It was a dozen years ago, when I was a
tenderfoot, with the usual allowance of
freshness and ignorance of frontier perils.
We used to call it brashness, and I was certainly
brash. I roamed around the country
for the better part of a year, with a more or
less vague purpose of settling somewhere,
but not caring much where. I had money
enough to start with, whenever I should find
an opening to suit me, but I was not in a
hurry, and was enjoying the freedom and
adventurous life of the plains as only a
youngster can who is not obliged to put up
with the hardships, but looks on them as
mere incidents.</p>

<p>“I was well down toward New Mexico
when there was a rumor of Indian troubles,
and I heard that a company of United
States troops were on the march toward one
of the principal villages, where the redskins
were particularly sullen. I had been out
hunting for a week with a couple of fellows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
I had met in one of the towns, when we got
the news from a stranger who came into our
camp late at night and asked for supper.
He admitted when we questioned him—not
too closely, for inquisitiveness is at a large
discount on the plains, but casually—that
he was a scout in the government employ,
and was on his way to join this company.</p>

<p>“‘There’s likely to be some pretty warm
work,’ he said when we asked a little more,
‘for if the red devils are not on the warpath
now they will be in a day or two, and you
fellows will do a smart trick if you turn
back.’</p>

<p>“Turning back, however, didn’t seem
very attractive to me when there was so
much excitement ahead. I promptly remarked
that I thought I would go on with
the scout and offer my services to the Captain
in command. I told you I was pretty
brash at the time, and I had no knowledge
of military affairs. My notion was that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
Captain would be glad of a recruit, or, at
least, that he would make no objection to
my going with him.</p>

<p>“I noticed that the scout looked at me a
little curiously, but he evidently thought it
was not his business to educate tenderfeet,
and he only grunted. My two companions
were as fresh as I was, and we told the scout
we would go along if he had no objection.</p>

<p>“‘It’s a free country, and I reckon you
can travel wherever you like,’ he said with
a grin that I understood better afterward.</p>

<p>“We started before dawn, and had some
thirty odd miles to go to strike the trail
where the company was expected to camp
that night. There were still some ten miles
to go when, as we were rounding a small
hill, the scout suddenly leaped from his
horse and called to us to do the same.</p>

<p>“He had seen Indians, and, to cut it
short, we camped that night in a place
where the scout said that four men could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
hold out for a while, even against the hundred
or so in the party that had surrounded
us. It was a certainty, though, that we
would all lose our scalps unless help came,
for there was no water to be had, and the
Indians knew it and made themselves comfortable
just out of range of our rifles. The
scout didn’t say much for a long time, but
we could see that he was thinking as hard as
any of us, and we were all pretty busy at it.
There didn’t seem to be anything to suggest,
or at least there was nothing that I could
think of excepting to make a dash and try
to break through. Nobody said anything in
reply when I spoke of that, and the scout
gave me a look of disgust that made me
angry enough, but shut me up all the same.
Finally he said:</p>

<p>“‘It’s just this way. These devils have
caught us, and they know it. They won’t
make a rush, for they know we will shoot,
and an Indian will never risk being shot if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
he can get his man without. We can’t fight
our way out. There’s too many of ’em.
And we can’t stay here any longer than we
can live without water.’</p>

<p>“I asked him if the Captain wouldn’t
make a search for him, and he said the Captain
didn’t know he was coming. ‘He’s
on his way south,’ he said, ‘and the trail he
is on is ten miles to the east of us. There’s
only one thing that I see, and that means
certain death for somebody, I reckon. It’s
certain death for all of us, though, if something
ain’t done.’ We asked him what it
was, and he said:</p>

<p>“‘If one man can make his way south-east
far enough, so that the noise of the firing
will reach the company, the Captain
will send a searching party. It all depends
on how far the man gets before he is killed.
If we all ride out, we will all be killed. If
one man goes, the others may stand a
chance.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
“We all looked at one another in silence
for a good while. My blood ran cold at
the idea of riding out alone into that pack
of fiends, but I realized that our only chance
was for somebody to go, and I knew life was
as sweet to the others as it was to me. Instinctively
we began first talking about the
way the man who should go should manœuvre
to best advantage, before raising the
question who should be the man. It took
only a few minutes, though, for the scout to
give his advice, which was for one to ride
out, waving a white handkerchief. He was
to keep to the eastward and ride as far as he
dared toward the Indians, looking sharply
for the weakest point in their line toward
his right. He should then make a dash and
ride as hard as possible until it was all over,
firing as often as he could. Then we had
to decide who should go, and I supposed,
of course, that we would draw lots, but one
of the men spoke up unexpectedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
“‘Whoever goes,’ he said, ‘doesn’t want
to start for some hours. The scout says
just after daybreak is the best time. What
is the matter with settling this thing with
poker? We can play freeze-out, and three
games will settle it, the winner dropping
out each time.’</p>

<p>“The proposition caught me. You know
I used to pride myself on my poker. After
a little hesitation the others agreed. The
man who proposed it had the cards, and we
counted out six hundred coffee beans for
chips and began playing on a blanket folded
and laid on the ground. You would think
the details of a game like that would fix
themselves in the memory, so that I would
be able to tell you every hand I held and
every bet I made, wouldn’t you? Well, I
can’t. In fact, I can’t tell anything about
the first game excepting that I was the first
man to lose all his chips. I had played
often enough for what I thought were high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
stakes, but the thought that I was playing
for my life rattled me completely, and I
really believe I bet at random. Whatever
I did I lost, and the man who had proposed
the game won out. He was shot in a gambling
house three months later—had an
extra ace in his sleeve, I believe, or something
like that.</p>

<p>“The next freeze-out, between three of
us, was a comparatively short one. It did
not take more than twenty minutes for the
scout to gather in all the chips, but short as
it was, I managed to get myself together a
little, though I was still full of the thought
of the value of the stakes—a thing which,
I have noticed, always interferes with my
play. When I consider the value of a chip
it always influences my betting one way or
the other, even though I try not to allow it
to do so, and in this case I said to myself
that each bean represented the one hundred
and fiftieth part of my life. In other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
words, I was gambling away months and
years instead of money.</p>

<p>“When the third game began, however, I
pulled myself together with a most tremendous
effort, and really became as cool as I
ever had been before at a game of cards.
The man I played against this time was a
young Englishman whom I had grown to esteem
highly in the short time I had known
him. He was a gentleman clear through,
and as cheery and companionable a man as
I ever met. His people at home never
heard this story, and I hope they never will.
They know he was killed by the Indians and
that he was on a hunting trip, but they never
heard of his last game of cards, nor of the
way he rode to his death. We had each
three hundred beans, and half a dozen hands
were dealt before either of us got cards to
bet on. Then on my deal I caught three
deuces and made it fifty to play. He looked
at his cards and raised me fifty, which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
covered. He drew one card and let it lie
without looking at it, while he watched me.
I saw him looking, of course, and I am more
glad than I am of almost anything else I
ever did in an almost useless life to think
that I made the worst play I ever saw made.
I liked the man well, as I said, and some
impulse that I couldn’t understand then,
and can’t explain now, told me to leave the
thing to chance, and to give him a little the
better chance. I had played with him before,
and I was certain that he had not come
back at me the way he did on two pair. He
was drawing to a flush, and somehow I felt
that he had filled it. Of course I should
have drawn to the strength of my hand, but
I didn’t. I drew one card only, holding up
an eight spot to my deuces, and I shoved all
my beans into the pot without looking at
my draw.</p>

<p>“He gave me one look, in which I read
a perfect appreciation of what I had done,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
and without a word and without lifting his
fifth card he pushed his chips forward.
Then my nerve gave out. I grew as white
as death, I know, though no one ever told
me so, and I actually could not lift my
cards. His nerve never shook, though, apparently,
and he turned his fifth card
over as he laid the other four on the
blanket. They were all clubs. He
looked at me, and I swear I saw regret
in his eyes. I tell you, he was a man.
Then I managed to control myself to turn
my hand over. I had drawn the other
eight.”</p>

<p>The Westerner stopped. He drained his
glass and then said:</p>

<p>“Waiter, bring another bottle, and bring
me some whisky besides. This stuff doesn’t
go to the right spot.” Then, after he had
had his drink, he said:</p>

<p>“You don’t wonder, do you, that I don’t
play poker any more?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
“No,” said his hearers, “but finish the
story.”</p>

<p>“Oh! there isn’t much more to it. At
least that is the end of it, as I think about
it. The Englishman shook hands with us
all, and rode away. We watched him until
he fell, and he must have gone fully three
miles. A good many Indians fell before he
did, for he was a clever shot. Later in the
day the company came to our rescue, and I
am glad to say a good many more Indians
paid for his death with their own.”</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>ENDING OF A POKER GAME IN FLOOD TIME
IN ARKANSAS CITY</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p>“I notice that the stories of lawlessness
and rambunctious violence printed in the
papers from time to time are told, as a rule,
of places far West or out of the usual run of
travel,” said the gray-haired young-looking
man who sat in the card-room of an up-town
club the other night after the game had
broken up. “I don’t mean by that,” he
continued, “to question the truth of any of
these stories. It only occurs to me that the
writers take unnecessary pains in going so
far away for their material. I have seen,
right along the banks of the Mississippi
River—and we call that pretty well East<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
now—some things as exciting as any of the
mining-camp yarns. And everything was
wide open in some of the towns, too. I
haven’t been out there since ’82, but that’s
not so long ago, and then it was not uncommon
to find a gambling saloon on the main
floor of the principal hotel in a flourishing
town. You could walk in as freely as you
could into the barroom and play faro, keno,
or poker at any hour of the day or night.</p>

<p>“The great flood of ’82 rather accentuated
the devil-may-care condition of things;
partly, I suppose, because there was not so
much traveling on the river as usual and
none at all by rail. Strangers were scarce
in the river towns, and the inhabitants were
reduced to the necessity of gambling among
themselves. No, there wasn’t what you
might call very much shooting, but every
man carried a pistol, and occasionally there
would be some. There was enough, at all
events, to make the citizens of Memphis enforce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
pretty strictly a city ordinance against
carrying concealed weapons.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said a drummer who was
of the party. “I was in Memphis then,
and I remember the Mayor of a Kentucky
city being sent to jail for ten days for carrying
a pistol. He had plenty of money and
plenty of influence, too, but neither could
save him from jail.”</p>

<p>“Well, Memphis was the only city I
struck on the river,” said the first speaker,
“where such a law was observed. I got
caught in Arkansas City, I remember, when
I was trying to get to Little Rock. I arrived
there just after the train had gone, so
I had to stay over for forty-eight hours.
It’s only about a hundred miles, but there
was only one train, and that took all day
going up and all next day coming down.
It was an accommodation train, and I saw
it stop fifteen minutes for a darky who signaled
from a distance, with a basket of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
eggs on his arm which he wanted to ship as
freight. The conductor told me, when I
asked about it, that that was quite usual,
and a little while afterward he stopped the
train to let a passenger get off and get a
quail that he shot from the car.</p>

<p>“But the stop in Arkansas City was lively
enough, if it was only two days. A darky
was drowned trying to get across the street,
the first day I was there, for the town was
so far under water that the railroad track on
top of the levee had been washed away.
Only the houses on the highest ground were
habitable, and there wasn’t such a thing as
a sidewalk visible. A few timbers were
strung along here and there, and people
jumped from one to another of these when
they went from house to house, unless they
were going far enough to take a skiff. This
poor fellow jumped and missed his footing,
and was drowned in sight of a dozen people.
I asked the man who told me about it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
whether any effort had been made to save
him, and he said no, that there was no boat
handy. And when I expressed some horror
he seemed surprised and said:</p>

<p>“‘Why, ’twas only a nigger. You
couldn’t expect a white man to take chances
to save him.’ Niggers were not so valuable
then as they were before the war.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that the color line was so
strictly drawn, though,” interrupted the
drummer again. “I saw a roustabout fall
into the river one night at New Madrid, and
he was a white man, too, but no effort was
made to save him. The mate stepped to
the side of the boat and looked over, but he
did no more, and not one of the other rousters
stopped work even for a moment. They
were unloading freight in a great hurry, and
I think they were afraid of the mate. It
was dark, to be sure, and the current was
swift enough to carry off the strongest swimmer,
but still I was surprised to see no effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
made to save the poor devil. Before I recovered
from my surprise it was too late to
do anything, and it didn’t seem to be wise
to say anything, either.”</p>

<p>“Good policy, sometimes, not to,” resumed
the young-looking gray-haired man.
“I learned to keep my mouth shut at a card
table a long time ago, and that is why I had
no part in a little disturbance that occurred
the second day I was in Arkansas City. I
don’t think there was more than one other
stranger in town when I was. He had come
there the day before me, on the train, and
was waiting for a boat up the river. I
struck up an acquaintance with him, and he
told me he was on his way home, after a
business trip. I congratulated him and we
took a drink on it, next door to the hotel.</p>

<p>“We were both tired waiting, and there
was nothing better to do in the place, so we
both sauntered to the room just back of the
bar. The door was wide open, and we saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
card-playing inside. Three men were playing
poker, and we stood for a few moments
looking on. One of the three was a comical-looking
old fellow, evidently a superannuated
gambler. He must have been
seventy years old, and his hands were very
shaky, but I could not make up my mind
whether he was palsied or had been drinking,
or whether he was assuming decrepitude
in order to watch the cards more carefully
as he dealt them. The latter seemed likely
enough, and I suspected marked cards, so I
pleaded ignorance of the game when one of
the other players—the proprietor of the
place, as I learned later—looked up with a
pleasant smile and suggested that perhaps
my friend and I would like to join in.</p>

<p>“My ‘friend,’ as he called him—I didn’t
even know his name—was willing enough,
and he sat in. I stood by, smoking and
looking on for a few minutes, though I pretended
not to be watching the game very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
closely. You can’t be too careful about observing
the etiquette of the place you’re in,
as I have always noticed, no matter what
place it is, and the people around a card
table are always liable to resent an outsider’s
interest if it even borders on inquisitiveness.
Where the resentment is liable
to be expressed with a knife or a pistol, a
wise man avoids showing his interest if he
has any.</p>

<p>“In this case I hadn’t a great deal. I
saw the game was crooked, but it made no
difference to me whether the other stranger
knew it or not. If he did it was dog eat
dog, and if he didn’t he deserved to lose
for playing with strangers in such a place.
However, I noticed pretty soon that the old
fellow, whom the others called Major, and
the proprietor, whom they all addressed as
Pete, were looking uneasily at me and at
each other from time to time, and that the
third player, whose back was turned toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
me, was making an ostentatious show of hiding
his cards from me, as if he suspected or
feared me and wanted me to know it. Accordingly
I thought the wisest thing for me
was to stroll back to the front room and
treat the bartender.</p>

<p>“While we were drinking, another man
came in. He wore no coat, vest, or hat.
He was, I think, the handsomest man I ever
saw, though he was slightly flushed with
liquor; not drunk, by any means, but he
had evidently been drinking. He was a
little above the medium height, with a
symmetrical form, magnificent chest and
shoulders, and the easy motion and graceful
carriage of a skilled athlete. He passed
directly to the card-room, nodding to the
barkeeper and merely glancing at me, and
I heard him say:</p>

<p>“‘Do you want another in the game?’</p>

<p>“The response was pleasant, and he took
a seat. Up to this time I had not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
greatly interested, as I said, and I continued
talking to the man behind the bar,
simply because I had nothing else to do.
The newcomer, however, was talkative, and,
as I noticed in a few moments, inclined to
be surly. He seemed to be trying to pick a
quarrel with the stranger, and I lingered,
with some natural curiosity, to see if he
would succeed. Presently the explosion
came. He lost a jack-pot which the stranger
won on three tens.</p>

<p>“‘You opened that pot on a pair of tens,’
he exclaimed with an oath, ‘and
when we catch any cross-roads gambler
playing that kind of a game in this town we
commonly hang ’em, do you understand?’</p>

<p>“It was said noisily and furiously, and I
looked in expecting to see a fight, but the
stranger spoke as coolly as though the other
had been calling for his draw.</p>

<p>“‘I did nothing of the sort, sir. I came
in on a pair of tens, as I had a perfect right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
to do, after the Major opened it, and I
caught the third ten in the draw.’</p>

<p>“‘I say you opened it,’ shouted the newcomer
with another oath.</p>

<p>“The stranger looked at him with the
most perfect composure and said:</p>

<p>“‘I appeal to the table. Gentlemen,
did I open it?’</p>

<p>“‘No, sir,’ said the old Major, promptly
enough. ‘I opened it myself, and dropped
out after I was raised twice. Jack, shut up!
The gentleman is playing all right.’</p>

<p>“But Jack wouldn’t shut up. On the
contrary, he became more furious.</p>

<p>“‘This is a hell of a game!’ he shouted,
and leaped to his feet like a panther, totally
oblivious of the few chips in front of him.
He had lost nearly all he had bought on
coming in.</p>

<p>“The stranger never moved, though I expected
to see weapons drawn. He looked
Jack full in the face with a sort of bewilderment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
on his own face, and said nothing.
Jack stood for a moment, and while I was
wondering whether the stranger was showing
nerve, or was really bewildered, he turned
suddenly and dashed out of the room.</p>

<p>“The stranger looked around at the other
players, and there was a distinct drawl in
his words as he said:</p>

<p>“‘What is the matter with that man?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, nothing,’ said Pete, carelessly.
‘You mustn’t mind him. He killed a man
yesterday, and he’s been drinking a good
deal to-day. He’s a little excited, but it
doesn’t mean anything.’</p>

<p>“‘But why did he rush out so curiously?’
persisted the stranger.</p>

<p>“‘Well, I suppose he went out to get
heeled,’ said Pete; ‘but you needn’t be
disturbed. The boys won’t let him come
back.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, perhaps they won’t,’ said the
stranger, still drawling his words, ‘but it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
just as well to be on the safe side. If you
will excuse me for a few minutes I’ll step
over to the hotel and get my gun. I left it
in my satchel.’</p>

<p>“‘Why, certainly,’ said the others, and
he arose, leaving his chips on the table, and
went out of the place. He said nothing
when he passed me, and I thought it best
to say nothing, too, but you couldn’t have
dragged me away just then. I suppose
every man likes to see a fight, and I thought
there was a good chance for one. I don’t
drink fast as a rule, but it seemed to be a
good time to treat again, and when the
glasses were emptied I said:</p>

<p>“‘Did he really kill a man yesterday?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the bartender indifferently.
‘There was a fellow tried to get funny with
him in his saloon next door, and when Jack
ordered him out and he wouldn’t go Jack
shot him.’</p>

<p>“‘Wasn’t he arrested?’ I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
“‘No, he wasn’t exactly arrested, but he
appeared before the Coroner and told how
it was, and the Coroner said he’d have to
lay the matter before the Grand Jury.’</p>

<p>“‘He wasn’t locked up, then?’ I persisted.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, no. You see, Jack’s very popular
around here, and he’s got quite some property,
too. I don’t think the boys would
have liked it much if he’d been locked up.’</p>

<p>“While I was meditating on this the
stranger came back, and, resuming his seat
at the table, laid his pistol alongside his
chips, which the others had not disturbed.
They dealt him a hand, and the game,
which had not been interrupted by his absence,
went on as before. No one made
any remark about the pistol or about the
man who had gone out to get heeled, but
the old Major pulled out a double-barreled
derringer and laid it on the table, and I
looked to see the others do the same thing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
but they did not. I had no doubt, however,
that they were armed, and they were
all looking for trouble.</p>

<p>“They had not long to wait. There was
a sound of voices outside, presently, and
looking out I saw Jack, still furious with
anger, apparently, breaking away from two
or three men who were evidently trying to
detain him, but who had a wholesome respect
for the revolver he had in his hand.
I looked around. The Major was dealing,
and the other players were watching him,
apparently, but I was satisfied that they had
heard the talk outside, and were all alert.
The bartender was safe to drop behind the
bar when the shooting began, and I looked
for some place where I should be able to
see and yet not be in range. There was a
window in the partition between the rooms,
about twelve feet to one side of the door,
and I stepped over there as Jack came in
toward the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
“Through this window I saw the most
magnificent display of cool nerve that ever
came under my notice. The stranger never
changed color, nor moved in his chair, but
I could see his eyelids contract and his lips
tighten as he quickly and quietly put his
hand on his revolver and looked toward the
door, at which Jack was just appearing, pistol
in hand.</p>

<p>“On the instant Pete drew a bowie knife,
with a motion so quick that I could not tell
where the knife came from, and drove it
square through the stranger’s hand into the
table underneath, nailing it fast to the
wood.</p>

<p>“If the stranger had even flinched, he
would have been dead in another moment,
for Jack’s pistol was leveled at him, but
with a motion as quick as Pete’s he reached
over with his left hand, seized his revolver,
and shot Jack through the pistol arm, shattering
his elbow, just as he was pulling his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
trigger. And the next instant he had shot
Pete through the heart, and turning to the
Major, he shouted, ‘Drop that gun!’</p>

<p>“The old fellow dropped it, and threw
up his hands. The other man had gone under
the table like a flash, being only anxious
to get out of the trouble. And Jack,
with a howl of pain and terror, had turned
and run. The fight was over before it was
fairly begun, and the stranger had not
moved from his chair.</p>

<p>“With his left hand he pulled out the
knife and wrapped up his right in a handkerchief,
and, stepping to the bar, said to
the bartender:</p>

<p>“‘You want to have a doctor here damned
quick to dress my hand. And while you are
about it, you’d better notify the Coroner, if
there’s one around. I propose to have
this inquest held before the witnesses get
away.’</p>

<p>“The Coroner was around; in fact, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
was playing cards only four or five doors
away, and in half an hour he was holding
his inquest. The stranger had shown his
good sense in demanding immediate action,
for though he was a stranger, the facts were
too plain for a dispute, and even one or two
of Pete’s friends on the jury were forced to
admit that the stranger had killed his man
in self-defense.</p>

<p>“He was accordingly informed by the
Coroner that he could go on his own recognizance
to appear before the Grand Jury,
and after treating the crowd at the dead
man’s bar, and paying for the treat with the
chips he had on the card table, he went
over to the levee and boarded a boat that
had stopped on her way up river.</p>

<p>“He had given his name to the Coroner
as Dick Davis of Tuscumbia, Ala., and I
afterward heard that he was really a cross-roads
gambler, as traveling card sharps used
to be called, and was a famous pistol shot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Why he did not kill Jack as well as Pete I
never really understood, for if the stories of
his marksmanship were one-half true, he
could have done it easily enough. I never
knew what the Grand Jury did about it.”</p>

<h2 id="ch_4">Queer Runs of Luck<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>VARIOUS YARNS, INCLUDING ONE OF THE
MAN AND THE OPAL</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p>“I have often heard people say that they
do not believe in luck,” said the gray-haired
young-looking man, “and they say
it in the sense of disbelieving that there is
any such thing as luck. To my notion that
is very much the same as if they should say
that they do not believe in the weather. I
believe it was John Oakhurst who said that
the only thing that is certain about luck is
that it is going to change; but although the
saying sounds philosophical, I am inclined
to think it is inaccurate. I have known a
great many men in the course of my life
whose luck did not change. To illustrate
this it may be enough to recall the stories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
that are told once in a great while about
sailors who are swept overboard by the
waves in a storm at sea and who are swept
back on board the same vessel by the return
current. The man who escapes drowning
in such a way experiences one of the most
extraordinary strokes of luck that can possibly
occur to a human being. And it is almost
inconceivable that such a thing would
happen to any one man twice.</p>

<p>“Yet I know a man to whom it has happened
three times. Captain Lowden White,
of East Rockaway, Long Island, is a veteran
seaman. He cannot swim a stroke,
and when he is asked why he never learned,
he cannot, or at least he does not, give any
clear answer, but turns the question with a
careless ‘I don’t know’ and a pleasant
laugh. I think he is superstitious about it,
as many sailors are, and certainly if anybody’s
experience justifies superstition his
would seem to, for, as I said, he has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
washed overboard three times in the course
of the last forty years, and each time washed
back immediately on board the vessel he
had just left. And that does not include
the times he has fallen or been knocked
overboard and saved in some other way. I,
myself, once caught him by the collar after
he had fallen into the water by reason of
the snapping of the bowsprit foot-rope of
the sloop “Martha,” near Wreck Lead. He
had rubber boots on, and the current was
running like a mill-race. If I had been
two seconds slower he would never have
come up alive. If it were a legitimate subject
for a bet I would wager any reasonable
sum that a man with such an experience
would never be drowned.</p>

<p>“That is what I call one of the most
wonderful runs of luck that I ever heard of.
And it is something of a coincidence, perhaps,
that Captain White himself is a firm
believer in his own luck in other matters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
though he does not talk much about his
escapes from drowning. He was in his
younger days fairly prosperous, and had
gathered together a modest competence
when he was between forty and fifty years
old. Then something happened. I hinted
that he was superstitious. What happened
was that he killed a cat. That does not
seem to the average man to be a very important
occurrence, but the Captain firmly believes
that it changed the whole course of
his life.</p>

<p>“‘I had always been lucky before,’ he
says, ‘and I have not had a day’s luck
since.’ And the fact is, that whereas he
was formerly well-to-do, he is not so now,
poor man.</p>

<p>“I suppose everybody who plays poker
believes in luck. Certainly I do, and I
have seen certain things at the card table
that in their way were as remarkable as the
runs of a single number at roulette, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
make up the pretty little romances that go
out from Monte Carlo at times, and that
used to be dated Baden Baden. I sat watching
a game one night at a friend’s house in
St. Nicholas Avenue, in which only intimate
friends were playing, and two of them
were ladies. I did not join, as there were
six at the table, and I don’t like a game
with seven in. There was absolutely nothing
in the game to distinguish it from any
other of the hundreds of games that go on
in the family circles of up-to-date New
Yorkers every night. The limit was five
cents. There wasn’t a player in the game
who knew enough of card manipulation to
deal a crooked hand, and there wasn’t one
there who would have done it under temptation.
And, moreover, there wasn’t anything
like temptation.</p>

<p>“Yet one woman in that game held a succession
of hands that would have made a
fortune for an ordinarily good player if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
were lucky enough to hold them in a stiff
game. She had been playing with indifferent
success for perhaps half an hour, and I
was amusing myself by noticing her essentially
feminine style of play, when she suddenly
began holding flushes. Five times in
succession she held a flush before any special
remark was made. Of course, there
was the usual chatter and chaffing, but when
she showed down the fifth flush in five deals,
there was a general outburst of comment,
and a confession by her that it did seem
uncanny.</p>

<p>“‘It will give me the shivery creeps if I
get any more,’ was the way she expressed it,
and I could see that she really was nervous.
That, naturally, amused me, for it was not
so very extraordinary, though it was certainly
unusual.</p>

<p>“The next hand she held nothing. Then
she got a four flush and filled. Then she
got a pat flush; then, drawing to the ace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
and king of spades, she got three more
spades. The next hand was nothing, and
the next was a pat flush. By this time I
was excited myself, as was everybody in the
game, and I made a memorandum of the
last eleven hands, and began jotting down
each hand as she held it.</p>

<p>“In thirty-six consecutive hands she held
twenty-seven flushes. None of the other
nine hands contained even a pair. Five of
the twenty-seven were pat hands; nine times
she drew one card, eight times she drew
two, three times she drew three, and twice
she drew four. There seemed to be no distinction
of suits. The flush was of one suit
as often as another. It was absolutely impossible
that there could have been trickery,
for there were six dealing in turn. The
lady herself was exceedingly nervous about
it, and although she became so excited as
to continue drawing for flushes, she ceased
to try to play them scientifically. Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
the other players ceased after a time to bet
against her, and the cards were at length
dealt more from curiosity than from any interest
in the game as a game. At length,
however, the lucky lady grew so nearly hysterical
that her husband made some excuse
to break up the game. I was sorry it had
to be done, too, for I wanted to see how
long such a run would continue, but the
lady has told me since that she never, before
or since, had any similar experience,
though she plays frequently.</p>

<p>“I never saw anything exactly similar to
that, but I had a run of luck once myself
that seemed to me almost as curious. I
went to visit a friend and there was invited
to sit down at a poker game with some men
I had never met before. The fact of not
knowing the other players did not worry
me, for I assumed that they were all friends
of Harry’s, but it was not long before the
fact that they did not know me began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
worry me most confoundedly, for I never
had such cards in my life before, and I
don’t dare even to hope that I will ever
hold them again. If the circumstances had
been different and I could have felt free to
play to win, I could have won big money,
for they were playing an open game, and
the limit was two dollars. At first I played
my hands for what they were worth, and I
won more than half the pots I played for—a
big percentage when six are playing. But
after a little I began to worry. It seemed
to me that they must mistrust me, and I
hesitated about betting as I ordinarily
would. Still I kept winning and my pile
of chips grew till I was positively ashamed
of myself.</p>

<p>“Then I started to try to lose money.
Fancy a man doing that at poker! I threw
down a number of hands that were well
worth betting on, and bet rather heavily on
some that I was convinced were losers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Even at that I got fooled once or twice and
took in pots that were not contested, when
the other players would have won them if
they had not grown cautious of my luck.
Still, I was reducing my pile slowly, in
spite of the cards I was getting, and would
have reduced it still further if the ladies
had not grown tired of their own society
and come out to look at the game. One or
two casual remarks by their husbands about
my luck excited their curiosity, and two or
three began looking at my cards.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what they thought of my
playing, for I still refused to press my luck
as even the most cowardly player would
have done, but I know they were fairly astonished
at the way the cards came to me.
Over and over again I filled full hands,
drawing to a pair; twice I held fours, and
the flushes were as common as two pairs
ever were when I played before. I played
at random. I made wild draws and foolish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
bets, and threw down winning hands, but
the chips kept coming my way till the situation
became positively painful. That luck
held till the game broke up, and, though I
had honestly tried to keep from winning, I
had seventy-five dollars cash to the good,
over and above the stack I bought on entering
the game. To make matters worse,
one of the players had given me some unmistakably
black looks, and in my embarrassment
I felt certain that he took me for
a card sharp, and I thought that the others
would be likely to share his opinion.</p>

<p>“When we were all saying good-night,
however, one of the players drew me one
side and whispered:</p>

<p>“‘We were very glad to see you win that
money.’ I was puzzled for fair, but I said:</p>

<p>“‘Well, I’m glad you’re glad, but why
should you be? I didn’t exactly like it
myself.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ he replied. ‘I saw you didn’t.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
But didn’t you notice that the man that
lost the most lost his temper also?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I did notice that.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ he chuckled, ‘he is the fellow
we have been trying all winter to catch.’</p>

<p>“That was a relief, but I never got over
my regret that the easiest winnings I ever
made at poker should have come when I
was trying my best to lose.”</p>

<p>“I quite believe, as you do,” said one of
his listeners, “that there is such a thing as
luck, but do you think that it is affected by
anything that we can possess?”</p>

<p>“Meaning a rabbit’s foot or a child’s
caul, I suppose,” said the gray-haired
young-looking man with a smile. “Well,
I wouldn’t like to declare myself on that
point, but I can tell you one more story that
is true within my own knowledge. About
five years ago I met a man on Broadway,
whom I had formerly known as a speculator
and a roving character in the West. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
was a good fellow, with a reputation for
being square that I had never heard questioned,
and he had, when I knew him well,
been unusually successful, so that he was
very well off for a young man. I was therefore
surprised to see that he looked very
seedy. Moreover, he had a discouraged
look which I had never seen on his face
before.</p>

<p>“I questioned him, and he frankly declared
that he was ‘dead broke’ and in
trouble. He had tried New York in the
hope of mending matters, but had decided
that his best chance was to go West again.
I offered to help him, but he would not borrow
more than a trifle, which he needed
toward his fare to Chicago. While he
talked I noticed that he wore a small but
very brilliant opal in his scarf-pin, and half-laughingly
I asked him if he ever expected
to have any luck while he wore that. It
was not an expensive stone, but it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
very pretty one. He looked at me, half
surprised, for a moment, and then he took
the pin out and looked at it thoughtfully for
several moments before speaking. At length
he said:</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know that I ever had any superstition.
In fact, I don’t know that I
have now, but it is certainly curious. I
bought that stone about two years ago, and
everything I have done in a business way
since then has resulted in a loss. I have
lost some thousands more than I had, and
have still to pay the debts. I think I’ll
throw it away. The setting is worth the
price of a dinner, I guess, so I’ll keep that.’
And he pried the jewel out with his pen-knife
and tossed it into the gutter.</p>

<p>“I met him again last week, and he returned
the loan, taking the bills off a roll
that it would do you good to look at. He
told me that his luck had changed the day
he threw the stone away, for he received a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
letter that afternoon which put him on the
track of a contract by which he made twenty
thousand within a year, and that since then
everything had prospered as it always had
before he bought the opal.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel called on to say what I
think about it, but those are the facts, and,
to say the least, they are curious.”</p>

<p>“I am not one who is disposed to quarrel
with the inevitable,” said the gray-haired
young-looking man as he lighted his pipe in
the club smoking-room. There had been
considerable discussion in the club as to the
propriety of allowing pipes, but he had
taken no part in it. He had simply kept
on smoking his pipe till the others had settled
the question, and when it was settled
he continued to have nothing whatever to
say.</p>

<p>“I don’t quarrel with the inevitable,”
he remarked, “and I realize that changes of
all sorts are among the things that are inevitable.
Modern progress cannot be stayed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
and modern improvements cannot be ignored.
We have new business methods,
new political doctrines, new translations of
the Bible, and even the new woman, and
there does not seem to be any possibility of
ignoring them, or even getting away from
them. I therefore make no objection to
change of any sort, further than to cling to
the old order of things myself, as far as I
can. Aside from that I am strongly in favor
of new-fangled ways—for those that like
them. Indeed, I always think of what President
Lincoln said: ‘For people that like
that sort of——’”</p>

<p>“Oh! forget it,” said the man with his
heels on the fender. “Excuse me,” he
added, as the other looked at him in mild
surprise, “but that is such an awful chestnut.
What has provoked you to philosophizing?”</p>

<p>“Was I philosophizing? Well, perhaps
I was. One of the youngsters asked me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
join in a game of poker a little while ago,
and I was going to do it, for I like poker
when the stakes are not too heavy, but he
told me they were playing with a joker.</p>

<p>“Now, they may get up a game of poker
one of these days with high, low, big and
little casino, and the right and left bowers
in it, and it may prove to be a game that
will be much liked by those who play it.
Certainly, I will have nothing against it.
But when I sit in at the game I want to
play it as I learned it. So I declined the
invitation.”</p>

<p>“Do you play it as you learned it?”
asked the other. “When I learned, four
aces couldn’t be beaten.”</p>

<p>“I must admit that point to be well
taken,” said the gray-haired young-looking
man, “for I can remember, myself, when a
straight flush was an unknown hand. In
fact, the first one I ever saw came near costing
two lives. But the straight flush, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
it was in its day a modern improvement,
was a legitimate development and not a
change in the game. The principle underlying
draw poker is that a hand is valuable
exactly in proportion to the difficulty encountered
in getting it—that is, according
to the smallness of the chance you have of
holding it. Fours were supposed to be the
hand that was the hardest to get, and so
fours were the winning hand. When somebody
discovered that the chances of holding
a straight flush were fewer than the chances
of holding fours, the straight flush took its
place strictly in accordance with the rules
of the game as already formulated. The
only reason it was not played from the first
was that it had not been recognized as a distinct
hand before. If somebody should discover
a new hand—that is, a new combination
of cards with a positive, individual
character of its own, sharply distinguishing
it from any other combination—that new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
hand might be admitted at its proper value
without changing the rules.”</p>

<p>“There is a certain amount of interest in
what you say, no doubt,” said the man with
his heels on the fender, “but it occurs to
me that there may be even more in the narration
of the circumstances under which you
made the acquaintance of a straight flush.”</p>

<p>“Now a ‘blaze,’” continued the other,
“is certainly a distinct hand, but it seems
to be a characterless sort of a thing, and not
entitled to much respect. And the same
may be said of the alternated straight. It
is true that an effort was made to introduce
the blaze, but it didn’t meet with much
favor. I don’t think it is played anywhere
now, and I never heard of anybody seriously
proposing to play alternated straights.
Come to think of it, the straight was not a
part of the old original game, and was not
universally played until within a few years.
I don’t imagine, though I never figured on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
it, that it is any harder to get than an alternated
straight, but it has a stronger character
of its own. That proves what I said,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“About those two lives,” said the other,
lazily moving his heels a little further apart.</p>

<p>“It was up in the pine woods of Minnesota.
I went there one winter to escape a
galloping consumption that my doctor predicted,
and had secured a job with Brown &amp;
Martin, a firm that had several lumber camps
in the woods. There was a gang of about
forty men in our camp, and there was nothing
particularly unusual about them, excepting
perhaps that there was rather more card
playing at night than the bosses liked to
have. I don’t know that it is prohibited in
any of the camps—certainly it was not in
those days; but gambling is discouraged,
for the men’s sakes as well as for the
bosses’, and as a rule there isn’t much going
on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
“The lumbermen are very impatient of
restraint, though, and no intelligent foreman
interferes with them much outside of
working hours, and as there were half a
dozen men in our camp who were inveterate
gamblers, the infection spread until there
were four or five poker games going on every
night. Our foreman was a Yankee from
Maine, a strapping big fellow, who did not
play himself, and strongly disapproved of
it, but he had a great amount of discretion,
and beyond speaking his mind freely he did
not try to stop it.</p>

<p>“This was thirty years ago, mind you,
and, as I said a moment ago, the straight
was not played everywhere. We played it,
however, for there were a good many there
who had become familiar with it, and they
insisted on it, and the few who were disposed
to grumble at it as a new-fangled notion
submitted, though not with the best
grace. If you remember, the straight, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
played then, only beat two pairs. Its value
as the lowest complete hand had not yet
been recognized.”</p>

<p>The other man nodded.</p>

<p>“One of the men in the party I usually
played with was Will Davison, a big, overbearing
sort of man, who grew sarcastic
whenever a straight was played, and who
made it a point to throw down his own
hand rather than draw to a sequence of four,
calling attention to what he did.</p>

<p>“‘I have no use for a boy’s game,’ he
used to say with a sneer, but the rest of the
party overruled him, and he liked the game
too well to stay out.</p>

<p>“One night a young law student from Columbia,
who had gone West as I had for his
health, joined our game, taking the sixth
hand. Davison didn’t like that, either, as I
noticed by his expression, but Harry Storms,
the student, was a general favorite, and the
rest of us all welcomed him, although we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
were a little surprised when he offered to
play, for he generally spent his evenings
poring over a law book, and we had thought
he didn’t know the cards.</p>

<p>“We speedily found out that he did,
though, and that he was not afraid to back
his hand for what he thought it was worth.
We played only a quarter limit, and as a
rule we kept pretty well inside of the limit,
too, so that it was not often that there was
more than two or three dollars, even in a
jack-pot. Storms, however, generally bet
the limit when he bet at all, and as the
boldest player generally sets the pace, we
were soon playing a stiffer game than had
been seen before in the camp.</p>

<p>“It was stiffer than I was used to, then,
for I was only a youngster, and hadn’t
played much, so I was naturally too much
absorbed to notice for some time that we
had attracted the attention of a number of
other men, who crowded around us, watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the play in silence. When I did look
up I saw Aleck White, our foreman, looking
on with an expression of profound dissatisfaction,
but as he said nothing I did not
feel like quitting the game, especially as
the luck was a little in my favor just
then.</p>

<p>“Presently there was a jack-pot of one
dollar and fifty cents on the table, and as
it went over three or four deals without an
open, it was sweetened up to three dollars
and odd before Storms threw in a quarter,
saying, ‘I open.’ I sat next to him, and,
looking at my hand, I saw that I had aces
up, so I stayed, of course. The next man
stayed also, and then Davison, who was
next, raised it a quarter. There seemed to
be some good hands around, for everybody
stayed, even after the raise, and there was
nearly five dollars on the board before the
betting began. It does not sound very exciting
now, but, as I tell you, we did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
play heavily. There were no professional
gamblers among us, and the men were all
working for day’s wages. A dollar meant
more then than it does now to me, and it
was a respectable sum to any of us.</p>

<p>“Before anybody drew cards Storms said:
‘Is there any reason why we shouldn’t raise
the limit for this one hand?’</p>

<p>“I had suspected him of bluffing once or
twice before that, and I thought this was
surely a bluff. Moreover, I had a fool sort
of confidence that I was going to get another
ace, so I said promptly: ‘I haven’t
any objections.’ Davison spoke quickly,
too. ‘Suits me,’ he said, and the others,
with a little hesitation, agreed: ‘Make it
fifty cents for this hand only,’ said one.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, hell!’ growled Davison. ‘Make
it a dollar while you are about it.’ I felt
that this was too heavy for me, but I was
too excited to object, and, as I said, the
hands must have been pretty good all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
around, for no one else remonstrated, and a
dollar it was.</p>

<p>“I did no better in the draw, and I had
sense enough to lay down when Storms threw
in a dollar, for he had stood pat, and I
didn’t feel like holding up a bluff from
where I sat. The next man had drawn two,
and he hesitated, but finally put up his dollar.
Davison held his hand pat also, and
raised Storms a dollar. The next two laid
down.</p>

<p>“Storms raised back, and my left-hand
neighbor laid down, leaving the struggle to
the two men. Davison raised it five dollars,
and one of the men who had pulled
out exclaimed: ‘I thought it was a dollar
limit?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, what business is it of yours?’
said Davison savagely. ‘Storms is the only
one that has a right to kick. If he is afraid
to bet I’ll stick to the limit,’ he added with
a sneer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
“Storms laughed. ‘I’ll see your five
and raise you ten’ he said, putting up the
money.</p>

<p>“Davison pulled out a wallet and, putting
a ten-dollar bill on the table, said:
‘That’s all the money I have with me, but
I’ll give you an order on my pay and raise
you ten.’</p>

<p>“‘And I’ll see that the order is not
paid,’ said the foreman, quietly.</p>

<p>“There was a moment’s silence, and then
the foreman spoke again. ‘I don’t propose
to interfere with anything you fellows do
within reason, but I am not going to see you
robbing your families.’</p>

<p>“‘He is right,’ said Storms. ‘I don’t
want to play out of reason. Perhaps we
have gone far enough.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, well, if you are afraid,’ said
Davison, insultingly, ‘I just make it a
call.’</p>

<p>“Storms laughed again good-naturedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
and said: ‘Well, let it go at that,’ and he
laid his cards down, face up.</p>

<p>“‘A flush, eh?’ shouted Davison.
‘That’s what I thought you had,’ and showing
down a king full on aces, he reached for
the pot. ‘That’ll beat anything but fours.’</p>

<p>“‘But my hand beats fours,’ said Storms,
also reaching for the money. ‘It’s a
straight flush.’ And so it was, jack high.
It was the first one I ever saw in play.</p>

<p>“‘Straight flush be damned!’ exclaimed
Davison. ‘Who ever heard of beating
fours?’ And as Storms still attempted to
take the money, Davison grappled him
across the table, shouting and cursing violently.</p>

<p>“Storms struck one or two blows, and
good ones, before any of us could interfere,
but as Davison had him in a close grip he
could not spar, and he seized the other’s
throat, choking off his wind instantly.</p>

<p>“The foreman jumped in, of course, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
did two or three others, but Davison had a
knife out in an instant, and if he hadn’t been
caught in time would have stabbed his antagonist.
As it was, it was a difficult thing
to pull them apart, for their blood was up,
and they would certainly have killed each
other if they hadn’t been stopped. When
we dragged them apart they struggled like
two wild beasts. And that broke up poker
playing in that camp for the winter, for the
foreman put his foot down hard.”</p>

<p>“And who took the pot?” asked the
man with his feet on the fender.</p>

<p>“The foreman made them divide it. I
don’t know as he had any right to, but his
word was law with us then.”</p>

<h2 id="ch_6">For a Senate Seat<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>A POKER GAME IN MINNESOTA THAT HAD
POLITICAL IMPORTANCE</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Poker has often been called the national
game,” said the gray-haired young-looking
man in the club smoking-room,
“but I fancy there are few citizens who
fully appreciate how much influence it has
exerted on the destinies of the nation in
one way and another. We hear stories now
and again of the winning and losing of fortunes,
and sometimes how large estates and
mining properties have been staked on the
chances lying between two hands. And
every lobbyist in the country is familiar
with the old device of losing large sums in
a friendly game with a legislator whose vote
is desired on one side or the other. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
things, naturally enough, sway public interests
as well as private to no small extent,
but I have seen a seat in the United States
Senate lost on four queens.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are not talking seriously,”
said one of the party.</p>

<p>“But I am,” was the answer, “seriously
and literally. It happened in Minnesota
soon after the war. Political conditions in
that part of the West were very different to
what they are now, and in fact all other
conditions were, too. It was at about the
beginning of the real growth of the North-west.
The value of the wheat fields had
been learned, but the Swedish and Norwegian
immigration was in its infancy, and
the lumber industry, that afterward grew to
such enormous proportions, was then making
comparatively few men rich. Minneapolis
was a small town on the south side
of the river, and St. Anthony was a town of
the same size on the other side. Now it’s all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
one city, but at that time nobody dreamed
of St. Paul being eclipsed in size or importance.</p>

<p>“I was knocking about late one summer
at that period, and had made many friends
around St. Paul and Minneapolis, some of
whom were State officials, and I had heard
much talk of the struggle there was to be in
the next Legislature over the election of a
Senator. Two men were in the race, and
as they were both popular the contest was
likely to be a close one. Party questions
did not enter in, for the State was strongly
Republican, and no Democrat stood a show.
But which of the two Republicans would
carry the Legislature was a matter of great
doubt, and I saw bets made on the issue as
early as the first of September. As the time
of election drew near, it was evident that
the choice for Senator was going to govern
the nomination of candidates for the Legislature,
and as both the Senatorial aspirants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
were long of head as well as long of purse
they were using all the influence they had
in the county conventions which were to be
held early in October.</p>

<p>“Right there was where the importance of
the lumber industry came in. The money
on which the lumbermen in the upper counties
lived came to them mostly through
Minneapolis and St. Anthony, and the perfectly
legitimate business relations between
them and the business men of those two
cities naturally gave the latter much influence
among the former. There was a rollicking,
happy-go-lucky man in Minneapolis
whom everybody called Doc Martin, for no
reason that I could discover except that he
wasn’t a doctor. He was part owner of a
saw-mill, and spent the most of each winter
in the woods with his men. He was credited
with being as influential as any one
there was, among voters, but he had a rival
in another man named Gilmartin, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
a logger himself, but had for a dozen seasons
been foreman of one gang or another.
Martin was a rich man, but Gilmartin was
seldom flush, excepting in the spring, when
he had drawn his winter’s pay. These two
men were known to be strong partisans, one
favoring one of the would-be Senators, and
the other the other, and it was generally
thought that they would both go electioneering
when the county conventions were held.</p>

<p>“The week before that was to happen I
was one of a party who drove from Minneapolis
to a road-house on the Fort Snelling
road near the Minnehaha Falls, partly for
the enjoyment of the moonlight and partly
for a game supper such as the house was
famous for providing. Martin was one of
the party, and as there were two or three
other high rollers with us, I had made up
my mind that it would be daybreak before
we would get back.</p>

<p>“I was right, but before the night was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
over we had more excitement than I had expected.
We had had the supper and an
abundance of good wine with it, and were
sitting around the table enjoying some rarely
good punch when somebody proposed poker.
No one objected, and in a few minutes there
were two games in progress, for there were
eleven in the party. Six played at one table,
and Martin and I and three others were
at the other. The game was a fairly stiff
one, ten dollars being the limit, and the
cards ran well enough to build up some
heavy pots. We had all indulged freely
enough to give ourselves thoroughly to the
enjoyment of the hour, though we had not
been drinking heavily, and there wasn’t a
man there under the influence. Altogether
it was a delightful occasion. Suddenly the
door opened, and Gilmartin looked in.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t want to “rough in,” boys,’ he
said, ‘but I stopped here to get supper on
the way home, and the landlord told me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
you were here, so I thought I’d ask you to
drink with me.’</p>

<p>“He was greeted heartily, for everybody
knew and liked him, and a bumper of punch
was poured out for him forthwith, his invitation
being peremptorily laid on the table.
Then, as a matter of course, it was suggested
that he take a hand in the game, and
he being more than willing, he sat at our
table.</p>

<p>“‘We’re playing ten-dollar limit, Gil,’
said one of the party, who knew that money
was not always plentiful with the big fellow.
But he laughed carelessly and said: ‘That’s
all right,’ as he pulled out a hundred-dollar
bill and bought chips.</p>

<p>“Martin looked at him rather keenly, as
I thought, for an instant, and said:</p>

<p>“‘Been out to St. Paul to-night, Gil?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, I have,’ said Gilmartin, and I
was sure that I saw a half-laughing look of
defiance on his face as he answered. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
puzzled me at the moment, but I understood
the question and answer afterward. Martin,
it seemed, suspected that Gilmartin had perfected
his arrangements to go electioneering,
and that he had the money in his pocket
with which he was expected to do his
work. It was this that he had asked by
implication, and Gilmartin, understanding
him perfectly, and knowing that he could
not keep his secret long from the other,
had admitted it. As it proved, he had
five thousand dollars in greenbacks with
him.</p>

<p>“The game went on without any special
development for perhaps half an hour before
I noticed that Martin was playing against
Gilmartin as heavily as he could, and only
trying to hold his own against the rest of us.
Gilmartin held his end up fairly, and was
not far from even when Martin got his first
good chance at him. It was a pretty play,
too, for Gilmartin thought, as the rest of us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
did, that Martin was bluffing when he stood
pat, and contented himself with coming in
without a raise every time it came his bet,
until the rest of us had dropped out. Then
he raised Gilmartin the limit. Gilmartin
had a jack-high flush and was confident, so
they had it back and forth till Gilmartin
called and gave up four hundred dollars to
an ace flush.</p>

<p>“That was the heaviest pot for a long
time, but presently the two got together
again, and Gilmartin lost two hundred
more. Then he grew a little nervous and
Martin grew cooler. Then Gilmartin became
angry, though he controlled himself
tolerably well, and I was sure that Martin
would beat him. So it proved. It came
my deal soon after in a jack-pot, and Gilmartin
opened it. We all came in, standing
Martin’s raise. I had aces, but didn’t
better in the draw, so I laid down after one
raise. Martin drew three cards, as did each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
of the others, excepting Gilmartin, who drew
two. He bet the limit, and the next man
laid down. Martin raised it the limit, and
another man and myself dropped out. Gilmartin
raised, and the fourth man threw
down his cards. That left the two alone
again, and Martin raised back.</p>

<p>“‘Ten better than you,’ said Gilmartin
savagely, and then with a short laugh he
added, ‘You won’t get away with me this
time.’</p>

<p>“‘If you think so,’ said Martin quietly,
‘what do you say to taking off the limit?’</p>

<p>“‘That will suit me exactly,’ said Gilmartin,
and Martin pushed up his last blue
chip and a hundred-dollar bill.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll see that and go you five hundred
better,’ said Gilmartin eagerly, and he
skinned the bills off from a big roll that
he drew from an inside pocket.</p>

<p>“‘Does my check go?’ asked Martin.
‘I haven’t so much money with me.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
“‘It’s good for fifty thousand, and you
know it,’ said Gilmartin.</p>

<p>“‘I raise you a thousand,’ said Martin.</p>

<p>“‘And I’ll go you a thousand better,’ exclaimed
the other. He was getting excited,
but nobody dared to speak. It was a serious
matter to interfere in a game like that.</p>

<p>“‘A thousand better,’ was the response.</p>

<p>“Gilmartin hesitated. He looked at his
cards and thought for a moment. Then he
counted his money.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll have to call you,’ he said finally,
‘for I’ve only got twelve hundred left.’</p>

<p>“Martin’s face was perfectly impassive.
He, too, hesitated a moment, and then he
spoke.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll put up five thousand more, if you
want to play for it,’ he said.</p>

<p>“‘But how can I? I tell you I haven’t
any more money,’ said Gilmartin, looking
puzzled.</p>

<p>“‘If you will give me your promise to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
go as far south as St. Louis for sixty days,
and tell nobody that you are going, I’ll take
that as an equivalent for the five thousand,’
said Martin very slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p>“Gilmartin flushed. He knew that everybody
in the room understood the proposition.
He was asked to sell out his honor,
for going away in that fashion meant betraying
his employer and running away with his
money, as well as leaving him in the lurch.
I expected to hear an indignant outburst of
invective and abuse, and indeed the man
was about to speak when another thought
seemed to strike him, and he grew deathly
white. The gambling fever had seized him,
and he looked at his cards again.</p>

<p>“While he was hesitating Martin spoke
again, and the devilish coolness of his
speech made me shudder.</p>

<p>“‘I need not say anything to impress on
the minds of all the gentlemen present that
this is a private party,’ he said, ‘and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
nothing which happens here can be told outside
while it can by any possibility work injury
to any one concerned.’</p>

<p>“Gilmartin looked round at every man
in the room, and seeing by our faces that
we all recognized the obligation, he seemed
nerved, as Martin had meant that he should
be, to take the risk.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll take the bet,’ he said at length,
and he spoke desperately. ‘But God help
you, Martin, if you win it. I don’t believe
you can, for I’ve got almost a sure hand.’</p>

<p>“‘If you lose,’ said Martin, ‘you have
no cause of quarrel with me. I am not
forcing you to play. But if you mean enmity,
all right. I’ll gamble your friendship,
too, along with the rest, if you like.’</p>

<p>“‘So be it,’ said Gilmartin. ‘It’s a
call, then. If you lose you pay me five
thousand. If I lose I leave.’</p>

<p>“‘Correct,’ said Martin, and the hands
were shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
“Martin had drawn to kings and caught
the other two. Gilmartin had drawn to
three queens and drawn the other.</p>

<p>“His face as he left the room was such a
picture as I hope never to see again, but he
kept to his bargain. At least, I imagine he
did, for he was not seen again in that part
of the country while I was there. I never
spoke to Martin again, but his friend was
elected Senator at the next session of the
Legislature by a majority of two votes.
Both men are dead, or I would not have
told the story.”</p>

<h2 id="ch_7">The Bill Went Through<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>THE USE THE LOBBY USED TO MAKE OF
POKER</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p>“It is no news to the average newspaper
reader,” said the gray-haired young-looking
man, “that there has been a vast deal
of heavy gambling done in Washington since
the capital of the nation was established in
that city. Stories without number have
been told and retold about famous statesmen
who have bucked the tiger in this and
that resort, whichever one happened to be
famous in its day, and who have won and
lost enormous sums as coolly as Englishmen
of equally high rank are said to have done
when Pitt and Fox played in the London
clubs. For one, I have little doubt that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
many of these stories are substantially true,
though most of them are probably embroidered
around the edges. Men who make
national politics the game of their lives
learn to love excitement, and next to politics,
gambling is about the most exciting
thing out. Some people even put it ahead
of politics.</p>

<p>“I am the more inclined to believe these
stories, too, because I remember a good
deal about what happened in a certain poker
club in that city a little while before the
Crédit Mobilier scandal. I was a youngster
then, but I had some reputation as a cool-headed
player, and I was fond of the game,
so it was not strange that after I had been
properly introduced and had sat in once or
twice, I got in the way of dropping in frequently,
and finally of spending most of my
evenings in this particular club-house until
after Congress adjourned and the season was
over. My business there was accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
at about the same time, and I left the city,
not to return for several years.</p>

<p>“The place was a modest-looking house,
just off Pennsylvania Avenue. It had been
designed for a private residence, and was
used as such by the proprietor, for, though
it was called a club, it was nothing more
than a private gambling-house. No one
could get admittance without a personal introduction
by some one whom the proprietor
knew and trusted, but once inside, a visitor
was made to feel as if he almost owned the
place.</p>

<p>“I never saw anything but poker played
in the house, but the game was sometimes
for tremendous stakes. Everybody seemed
to have almost unlimited money who came
there to play, for money was plentiful in
Washington that year, and a thousand-dollar
bet was no more an occasion for surprise
than one of fifty dollars, though a five- or
ten-dollar limit game was common enough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
too. You could play a modest game if you
liked, for there were several tables going
every night, but if you preferred, you could
generally get into a table stakes game and
flash any sort of a roll you saw fit. I never
saw a professional gambler in the house, excepting
the proprietor. He was one, but
he never played in his own place, and so
far as I know, there was never a suspicion
of a crooked play in any of the games that
I saw.</p>

<p>“And as to the men who played? Oh!
well, it would do no good to name names.
Some were men whom nothing could injure
in reputation. Some are dead. Others are
out of politics. And not a few would be
sorry indeed to be mentioned in connection
with high play at a time when their ostensible
income was not sufficient to warrant it.
It was a season, however, in which no man
prominent in official circles was obliged to
be without money, provided he could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
induced to accept it. It is enough to say
that one of the unwritten rules of the ‘club’—it
had no written ones—was that any
man’s I. O. U. was good, but that it must
be taken up within forty-eight hours. And
I never heard of an infraction of the rule.</p>

<p>“In one or two cases I would have been
glad to hear that the man giving his paper
thus, had had the nerve to repudiate it and
quit the game. One Congressman in particular
I remember who might have been a
man of distinction according to all indications,
if he had been willing to shoulder the
odium of an unpaid ‘debt of honor’ instead
of lending himself to the lobby and accepting
money for his vote. How do I know
it? How does a man know anything he
doesn’t actually see? I knew the circumstances
leading up to his ruin well enough.</p>

<p>“What I did see was the way the lobby
tried him night after night, for it was an
open secret that this particular poker club<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
was one of the channels through which the
crack lobbyists of the season reached their
men. A good many games were played to
lose, in the big parlor, and more, I reckon,
in some of the small rooms, but the man
who won in such a game was always a man
who was wanted for something. Of course,
when it came to handing over the cold cash
as a specified payment for a particular service,
it was done in private, but different
men have to be approached in different
ways, and poker affords some peculiar opportunities.</p>

<p>“This Congressman—call him Smith for
short—was particularly wanted in one
scheme that hung fire for a long time in the
committee-room. He was a member of the
committee, and for local reasons connected
with his home district could have decided
the matter either way, but being a conscientious
fellow, he had held it up in a way
that exasperated the lobby greatly. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
been approached in various ways, but had
proved obdurate, and not until he had been
introduced at the club did there seem to be
any chance of winning him.</p>

<p>“Even then it was not easy, for he refused
at first to play for any considerable
money, but he was fond of the game and it
undid him at the last. He was led on by
degrees—the finesse and astuteness of a
really gifted lobbyist is something almost
diabolical—until, being a fairly skilful
player, he found himself encouraged to
plunge. Then the real game began.</p>

<p>“At first he was allowed to win. I say
allowed, because the men against him were
far better players than he, though they did
not let him suspect it. One night he won
so heavily that at the conclusion of the
game he had Jones’s I. O. U. for over seven
thousand dollars. Jones was the man the
lobby had put against him, and what he had
to do was to meet Smith privately next day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
and hand him the money, and at the same
time urge the passage of the bill they
wanted. Of course the money could not be
considered in any sense a bribe, but Smith,
in taking it, could not possibly refuse conversation,
and would, it was thought, be inclined
to listen favorably to a man who lost
money to him as gracefully as Jones did.
He couldn’t be expected to know, and as a
fact, he did not know, how easy it was for
Jones to lose gracefully, since the money
was furnished to him for the purpose.</p>

<p>“It was the most delicate sort of diplomacy,
but it failed completely. Smith was
gentleman enough to feel the temptation,
and man enough to withstand it. The loss
of the money was not considered for a moment
by the lobby. They had money to
burn. But the failure to get Smith was important,
so other tactics were employed.</p>

<p>“There was no necessity for asking him
to give Jones his revenge at the game, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
he was by this time in the fever of play, and
he was at the club every night, looking for
the opportunity that somebody was always
ready to give him. It did seem almost
pitiful to see a man of his talents and character
fluttering like a big fool moth around
a flame that was almost certain to destroy
him, but it didn’t seem to be anybody’s
business to tell him what he ought to have
known for himself. At any rate, nobody
made it his business. I, for one, considered
that it was the part of wisdom to say
nothing. It’s a good safe rule generally,
and I was too young a man to play mentor
to one who had reached his rank.</p>

<p>“Nothing was done hastily. The lobby
never makes mistakes of that sort. Smith
was allowed to play along for perhaps a
week before Jones was put at him again. I
don’t know exactly, but I think a part of
the calculation was to wait till his luck
should turn, for he had been winning before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
he made his big stake from Jones, and he
continued to win for several nights, though
he got no very important money after that.</p>

<p>“Luck does change, though, and in a
week he was losing, not heavily, but enough
to whet his desire, and it was noticeable
that he grew more and more eager for high
play. The time had come for the decisive
stroke, and Jones, of course, was on hand at
the proper time to deliver it.</p>

<p>“There were only four players in the
game that night, and it was played in the
big parlor. The lobby never made the mistake
of seeking privacy unnecessarily, and
Smith, though he was infatuated with the
game, was the sort of man to take alarm
quickly at anything that looked suspicious.
So it happened that I was one of the
lookers-on at a memorable contest.</p>

<p>“Smith didn’t know it, but there were
three against him that night, although one
of them was a fellow-Congressman who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
not known to be interested in the scheme,
and another was a Westerner, who had only
been introduced at the club two or three
nights before, and had only played there
once. The fourth man, of course, was
Jones.</p>

<p>“The play went on for half an hour before
anything serious happened. Occasionally
there would be some pretty big bets,
but they all won and lost so nearly even
that no one was much ahead. Then to an
outsider it became evident that each of the
other three was playing for Smith’s money,
although Smith himself did not, I believe,
suspect anything of the sort. As I said, the
play was straight enough, but three first-class
players can bring any ordinary player
to grief easily enough in a four-handed
game without any crooked manipulation of
the cards, if they work in concert, and
Smith was soon losing heavily.</p>

<p>“They knew the size of his pile pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
accurately, for they had kept tabs on him
closely ever since he began playing, and
there wasn’t a detail of his outside business
that hadn’t been studied carefully beforehand.
So when he had been coaxed along
to a ten-dollar ante, with occasional bets of
as much as five hundred, they knew that
they could reach his uttermost limit easily
enough, for he couldn’t have raised much
over twelve thousand dollars in cash to save
his life, without getting outside help somewhere.
Twelve thousand dollars isn’t much
of a wad to sit in a game with, if there is
unlimited money against you, and the betting
runs up into the hundreds, so Smith
was on pretty thin ice all the time, though
he didn’t realize it until it was too late.</p>

<p>“He had four or five thousand with him
in money, but when that was gone the rule
of the place made it fatally easy for him to
go on, and I really believe that he lost his
head as the play went on, and he gave check<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
after check in payment for more chips.
The proprietor understood well enough what
was going on, and he took the checks with
perfect readiness, knowing that he would be
protected. Smith bought again and again,
keeping no memorandum, until he was in it
for over ten thousand.</p>

<p>“Then came the deciding hand. We did
not play straight flushes then, so fours of
any denomination made even a stronger
hand than they do now, and Smith caught
four eights. There isn’t a poker player on
earth who wouldn’t look on that as a chance
to recoup, and very few who wouldn’t risk
their pile on the chance. Smith did it anyhow,
and came to grief. He risked more
than his pile, for, as it happened, the other
Congressman held a good hand, too, and bet
freely for a little while. Jones had four
queens and scooped the pot. The Westerner
wasn’t in it.</p>

<p>“All the chips were in the center when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
Smith raised it a thousand, putting up a
marker in the shape of an I. O. U., hastily
scribbled. The other Congressman dropped
out, and Jones came back with another thousand.
Smith was fairly white, but he
reached over and changed the figures on his
I. O. U. from $1,000 to $4,000, saying
quietly, ‘Two better.’</p>

<p>“‘Two more than you,’ said Jones, just
as quietly, laying four one-thousand-dollar
bills on the table. And then there was
dead silence in the room.</p>

<p>“Smith paused, and it seemed to me that
I could read his thoughts. He was eager
enough to go on with the play, but though
he did not know, and could not stop just
then to reckon how deeply he was dipped,
he knew he was over his head. Moreover,
four eights, strong as it was, was not an invincible
hand, and his better sense urged
him to call.</p>

<p>“Finally he did, and when the showdown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
came, I thought for a moment he would
faint. He rallied, however, and like the
gallant fellow he was, made some light remark
with a half-laugh as he rose from the
table.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve got enough for to-night,’ he said,
and the game was over. I never knew all
the circumstances of the settlement, but I
know the bill was reported favorably by the
committee within a week, and that Smith
used to hang around the club-house more
persistently than ever for the rest of the season.
As for Jones, I never saw him after
that night.”</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>A BOUT WITH CARD SHARPERS ON A
MISSISSIPPI BOAT</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p>“I have always found it hard to believe
the stories I used to read about the luxury
of travel and the magnificence of the appointments
on the great Mississippi River
steamboats,” said the gray-haired young-looking
man in the club smoking-room.
“It seems to be the generally accepted belief
that forty years ago or so people went
up and down on the bosom of the Father of
Waters in floating palaces, enjoying something
like the extreme of sumptuous luxury.
Maybe that is true. I didn’t travel the
river so long ago as that, and, of course, I
can’t say what the condition of things may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
or may not have been when I wasn’t there
to see. What I can say positively is that if
it was true in those days, the war or some
other disturbing cause changed things very
materially before I became as familiar as I
did afterward with the river boats. My notion
is that the whole thing is a tradition,
resting on very little foundation excepting
comparison. The mere fact of having a
stateroom to sleep in, with only one stranger
as a room-mate, and a seat at a table
with room for a waiter to pass behind you,
served to make travelers at that time think
they were in luxury, because they hadn’t experienced
it before. And I imagine, from
what I know of a later period, that that was
about the extent of the luxury. Certainly
none of the boats I was ever on, in the ’60s
and ’70s, compared with the North River or
the Sound boats of the same time. And
even those would not seem very luxurious to
travelers of the present day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
“But there were a good many stories told
about the old-time Mississippi boats that I
am fully prepared to believe. That the
game of poker flourished on the river as it
never has elsewhere, before or since, seems
entirely probable. I have seen games that
made me hold my breath because of the size
of the stakes, and because of the fact that I
knew the players were all armed, and a shot
or a stab was certain to follow a hasty word
or a suspicious act.</p>

<p>“It was on a trip from Memphis to Natchez
that I first saw a woman gamble in
public. The boat wasn’t crowded, but there
were perhaps fifty passengers on board, and
among them were six or eight ladies and
this woman. That she was a social outlaw
was evident enough at a glance. Not only
were her clothes of a fashion too pronounced
for respectability and her jewelry too ostentatious
for daylight wear, but there was a
frank devilry in her eye, and a defiant swing—almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
a swagger—in her carriage that
told the story all too plainly. Her behavior
was correct enough. She was, or
seemed to be, traveling alone, and she took
the somewhat too ostentatious avoidance of
the ladies in perfectly good part, pretending
to be utterly unconscious of it, and ignoring
them as completely as they did her.
Neither did she give any overt encouragement
to the efforts that some of the men
made to cultivate her acquaintance. It was
evident that while she took no pains to conceal
her character, she did not propose to
make herself obnoxious. Naturally every
one was curious to know who she was, and I
soon learned, as I supposed the other passengers
all did, that she was a notorious
character in New Orleans, where she was
known as ‘Flash Kate.’ What her business
had been in Memphis I did not hear, but a
dozen stories were told of her recklessness
and general cussedness, and among other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
things it was said that she was a confirmed
gambler.</p>

<p>“After supper the first evening we were
on board, the tables in the main saloon were
cleared, and, as if it were a matter of
course, two games of poker were soon in
progress. It was plain enough that two of
the men in the game that I watched at first
were professionals, but the game was small,
and I found no great excitement in it,
though it was, in a way, interesting to notice
how easily the others were being fleeced.
Tiring, after a time, of watching so bold a
fraud, I sauntered over to the other table,
and found a very different game in progress.</p>

<p>“In the first place, it was a bigger game.
They were playing table stakes, and each
man had a wad of greenbacks lying alongside
his chips. White chips were a dollar,
and bets of ten or twenty at once were common.
There were several thousand dollars
in sight, and it looked as if any moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
might bring on a struggle between hands
that would draw down big money. Then it
did not take long for me to determine that
two of the men in this game also were professionals.
The third man at the table I
knew. He was a cotton-factor from New
Orleans, who had been up the river on a
business trip investigating some of the advances
he and his partner had made to the
planters. He was young—not over thirty,
I should say—but I knew he had the reputation
of being a bold speculator, and it did
not seem surprising to see him at cards.
The other two men—there were five playing—puzzled
me. One was a veteran soldier.
You could tell that from his military bearing
without waiting to hear him addressed
as ‘Major,’ but an ex-soldier of either army
might be anything from a gambler to a bank
president. The other was a nondescript.
There didn’t seem to be any points about
him to distinguish him from anybody else,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
but I afterward learned that he was a cattle-dealer.</p>

<p>“The game lasted far into the night, and
was interesting all the way through, but,
somewhat to my surprise, there was no very
desperate struggle over any single pot. The
hands ran fairly well, and some few big ones
were held, but no two unusual ones happened
to be held in the same deal. So far
as I could see, the play was absolutely fair,
and I wondered a little that the gamblers
should attempt no tricks. Later on I understood
it. They were laying the foundation
for the second night’s play, and their
game was to lose a little at the first sitting.
Accordingly they did so, and one pulled out
soon after midnight, saying with a laugh
that he had lost all he wanted to. The cotton-factor
was a loser, too, though not to
any very serious extent. The other two
were ahead. Altogether it was a pleasant
sitting, and it was a foregone conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
that the game would be renewed, as it was,
the next evening. After supper the five
seated themselves without loss of time, and
the spectators stood, two deep, around the
table inside of a few minutes. The clerk
of the boat was banker, and furnished the
cards and sold the chips, as a matter of
course.</p>

<p>“For half an hour or so there was no
special play, but the lookers-on were patient,
and the excitement grew with every
deal. It was the first time I ever saw ladies
look on at public gambling, but there were
three or four on board who walked in, holding
their husbands’ arms, and watched the
proceedings with keen interest. Presently,
however, ‘Flash Kate’ sauntered up alone,
and the ladies seeing her, quietly withdrew.
She paid no attention to this, but stood apparently
absorbed in the game, and edging
forward from time to time till she stood
directly behind the cotton-factor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
“The betting grew heavier. The ante
was made ten dollars and the bet was often
fifty, but still there was no contest between
unusual hands. We all knew it was coming,
though, and I noticed that three or four
of the men near me were breathing hard.
‘Flash Kate’s’ eyes sparkled like a snake’s
and her lips were parted, but she was as
silent as we all were. Even the players
said nothing outside of the few words the
game called for.</p>

<p>“Suddenly I heard a sort of gasp from
the man next me, and at the same instant I
saw the fellow they called Keene hold out
an ace. It was cleverly done, and yet I
marveled at his nerve in trying such a trick
under so many watching eyes. He relied,
of course, on his skill, which was really
marvelous, but I had studied such things
too closely to be mistaken, and as, for an
instant, I met the eye of the man who had
gasped, I saw that he was equally certain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Neither of us was fool enough to say anything,
for interference meant fight, and I
wondered for a moment what would follow,
or if any of the players had seen it.</p>

<p>“It was the deal of the cattle-dealer,
whose name was Downing, next, and as he
gathered up the cards he threw them, with a
quick motion, on the floor, saying: ‘Bring
us a fresh deck, Mr. Clerk, of another color.’
It seemed certain that he had seen
Keene’s manœuvre, but if he had he gave
no other indication of it, but shuffled and
dealt the cards as coolly as if nothing out
of the way had happened. Neither could I
see any trace of chagrin or disappointment
on Keene’s face as he was thus cleverly
checkmated. He looked sharply at Downing
for an instant, as if to see whether he
had really been discovered or not, but that
worthy did not return the glance, and the
game went on.</p>

<p>“Soon after there was a jack-pot that went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
around several times before it was opened,
and of course there was considerable money
up. Presently, on the cotton-factor’s deal,
Alcott, the other professional gambler,
opened it for a hundred dollars, and all the
players came in. That made big money
before the draw, and no one was likely to
get away with it without a struggle. The
Major drew one card, and without waiting
for further developments, threw his hand
into the discard pile. He knew he wasn’t
strong enough to bluff that crowd. Alcott
drew three, and threw another hundred into
the pot. Downing drew two, and left them
lying face down, while he threw in his hundred.
Keene also drew two, and studied
them carefully before seeing the bet. The
cotton-factor drew three, and raised it a
hundred. I could not see his cards, but I
learned afterward that he had a queen full.</p>

<p>“Alcott had three of a kind and raised
back. Downing carefully lifted one corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
of one of the cards he had drawn and lifted
the pot two hundred. Keene studied a
while longer and finally threw down his
cards. The cotton-factor was game and
raised it five hundred, but Alcott, without a
quiver, came back at him with a thousand
more. The battle was on, and I looked
curiously at Downing. I was more interested
in his play than in that of either of
the others, and it was a real disappointment
to see him pick up his whole hand, give it
a quick glance, and throw it down. The
cotton-factor studied his hand again, more,
it seemed to me, to gain time than to make
certain, and then began fingering his roll.
At length he spoke a little hesitatingly:</p>

<p>“‘I haven’t as much money here as I’d
like to have, but I’ll see your thousand
and——’</p>

<p>“‘If Monsieur cares to back his hand
and will allow me, I will put up any
amount he likes.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
“It was ‘Flash Kate’ who interrupted
him—no man would have ventured to do it—and
there was a general start of surprise.
I was looking at Alcott, and I was sure I
saw a gleam of satisfaction, totally unmixed
with surprise, on his face. The situation
was getting complicated. The cotton-factor
flushed.</p>

<p>“‘Thank you,’ he said, coldly, without
even looking around, ‘but I never play with
borrowed money, and I never borrow from a
woman.’</p>

<p>“‘Pardon me,’ said ‘Flash Kate,’ as
coolly as he, ‘I hope there is no offense,
Monsieur. None was intended.’ She spoke
with a villainous affectation of a French
accent.</p>

<p>“‘None whatever,’ said the cotton-factor,
and he looked at his cards again. He
told me afterward that when the woman
spoke it flashed upon him that there was a
conspiracy somewhere, and that he didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
care to play against it. Accordingly, he
pretended to study a moment longer, and
then threw down his cards.</p>

<p>“Alcott raked in the money without a
word, and the cotton-factor, putting the remains
of his roll in his pocket, picked up
his chips and left the table, saying politely
as he arose: ‘Excuse me, gentlemen, I
think I have had enough.’</p>

<p>“There was a moment’s hush. The four
players looked around the spectators, as if
to see if any one cared to take the vacated
seat, but no one gave a sign, and presently
Keene said:</p>

<p>“‘Madame is interested in the game.
Perhaps she plays, and would like to take a
hand.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, if there is no objection,’ she said
readily, and looked from one to another of
the four at the table. Downing said nothing,
but there was a grim smile on his face.
The Major looked uncomfortable, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
said nothing, either, and as Alcott said,
‘Certainly there can be no objection,’ the
woman took the seat and laid a handful of
money on the table in front of her.</p>

<p>“From the moment she sat down I felt
morally certain that it was a case of three
against one, for the Major was not much in
evidence. And I was pretty confident that
the man from Texas was going to hold his
own, as indeed he did triumphantly. For
nearly twenty minutes his play was a perfect
puzzle, and the trio got actually nervous as
he threw down hand after hand that ordinarily
he would have betted heavily on.
They stacked the cards, not once, but half
a dozen times, giving him excellent cards,
but he pretended to have lost his nerve, and
played now with seeming rashness, and now
with cowardice, but never risking any considerable
amount, until he had them rattled.</p>

<p>“Then he played a trick that was worthy
of the great Herrmann himself. It was at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
once the boldest and the neatest thing I
ever saw at a card table, and although I
thought I saw it done, I was not certain
about it till he told me of it after we had
become well acquainted. It was Keene’s
deal and Downing’s cut, and the latter,
watching, as he did, every motion around
the table, knew that Keene’s nerve had
failed him, and that he had not this time
undertaken to set up the cards. His time
had come, and as he leaned over to cut he
substituted another pack for the one Keene
had shuffled. It sounds like an impossibility,
but wonderful things are possible to a
sleight-of-hand performer, and he was the
best I ever saw at a card table. Not one of
the other players saw it, but he knew that
deal every card that every player would
hold.</p>

<p>“And they held wonderful cards—all but
the Major. It was his first say, and he
dropped out. Alcott came in and discarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
two cards. Downing was next. He
raised it twenty and threw down three cards.
Keene raised it fifty, and threw down one.
‘Flash Kate’ came in with threes, but did
not raise. Alcott saw the raise, and Downing
raised it a hundred. The others all
came in, and the draw was dealt.</p>

<p>“They all filled, of course, and it being
Keene’s deal, they suspected nothing, but,
each being confident of his own strength,
they betted wildly. It was almost too
quick work to follow, but in a few minutes
Keene said: ‘I claim a show for my pile,’
and pushed the money already in the pot a
little to one side. The others nodded, and
went on betting.</p>

<p>“Presently Alcott also claimed his show,
and Downing and ‘Flash Kate’ went on.
She must have had five or six thousand with
her, for there was over twenty thousand on
the table when she called, with what appeared
to be the last of her money, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
came to a showdown. Keene had four
jacks, Alcott four queens, ‘Flash Kate’
four kings, and Downing four aces.</p>

<p>“For an instant there was perfect silence.
Then Alcott and Keene made a movement
simultaneously, as if to seize the money;
but Downing was quicker than they. It was
impossible to say where he drew his revolver
from, but it was there in his right hand,
while he coolly pulled in the money with
his left.</p>

<p>“‘That was no square deal,’ shouted
Alcott, though neither he nor Keene made
any fight.</p>

<p>“‘Think not?’ drawled Downing.
‘Well, you ought to know. Your pal
dealt the cards. But I think you are right.
There’s been some queer play here to-night.
But there’s one honest player in the party,
and he isn’t hurt much. As for me, I reckon
this’ll do me, unless some of you want
to play any more.’ And he grinned at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
discomfited gamblers, who, seeing that they
had the worst of it, said no more.</p>

<p>“‘Flash Kate’ took it the best. She
looked on with a smile while this was going
on, and when it was over, she smiled some
more, and rising from her chair, said sarcastically:
‘Monsieur is a most excellent
player.’ And she went to her stateroom
without another word. I noticed when we
reached Vicksburg that she and Alcott left
the boat together.</p>

<p>“‘Those three were pretty slick players,’
said Downing to the crowd, as he ordered
champagne for everybody who would take
it, ‘but they ought to travel in Texas for a
time if they want to get on to the safest
kind of play.’</p>

<p>“It was only an episode in the old river
life, and as nobody was much hurt excepting
professionals, nobody thought much about
it.”</p>

<h2 id="ch_9">“Overland Jack”<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>HOW A WESTERN CROOK HAD FUN WITH
SOME SHARP NEW YORKERS</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p>“I don’t know how far local pride may
color the judgment,” said the gray-haired
young-looking man, “but I am satisfied that
very few New Yorkers would be willing to
admit that an all-round sport could come
here from the West and clean up the town,
metaphorically speaking. That is, tackle
the experts of the city at their own different
games and win money from one after another
without losing to any of them, and
finally depart after a season of riotous success
with his pockets laden with spoils.
Such a thing does not seem likely. Yet I
remember one case in the ’70s when just
that thing was done by one of the best-known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
gamblers in the United States.
‘Overland Jack’ was the name by which he
was usually called, but his real name was
John McCormick. He cut a very wide
swath when he first came to New York, but
he made a good many friends here, too, not
only among the sporting fraternity, but
among actors and men-about-town generally.</p>

<p>“The fact of his having a goodly number
of friends was manifest when he came to die
afterward in Chicago. He knew, toward
the last, that his death was near, but instead
of weakening he recalled the incidents
of his career with the utmost satisfaction,
and declared that he had no regrets for
the way he had spent his life, but, on the
contrary, considered that he had done excellently
well with it. As a token of his
feelings, he expressed the wish that his
friends should go to his funeral, not with
religious ceremonies, but with champagne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
galore, and that in place of praying for his
future they should drink to his memory over
his open grave.</p>

<p>“It was just such a crowd as he would
have selected that went to his grave and
carried out his wishes. Tony Pastor, Jack
Studley, Pat Sheedy, Johnny Blaisdell, Mike
McDonald, and many others were there.
There were enough, at all events, to get
away with five baskets of wine before the
grave was filled in, and the empty bottles
were thrown in on the coffin. It was a
memorable occasion, even for Chicago, and
it occurred only a few years ago. It was in
’90 or ’91, if I remember aright.</p>

<p>“The time I speak of, however, was before
he was known on this side of the continent,
excepting by reputation. Overland
Jack, the sport, came from San Francisco.
Where John McCormick, the man, came
from originally no one seemed to know.
The first that could be definitely stated was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
that he was a private in a California cavalry
regiment at the time of the Civil War. He
never rose from the ranks, but he was always
well supplied with money, even when on
duty, for he was far and away the best poker
player in the regiment. After the war he
never did anything but gamble for a living.</p>

<p>“He was a quiet man, who was so uncommunicative
about himself that his best
friends could not even say with certainty
whether he was a well-educated man or not,
but he was always smiling and extremely
pleasant in his manner. It was said of him
that he was never known to be angry, but I
have heard this disputed. Certainly he had
no reputation as a fighter, though he took
his life in his hands often enough in his
play, for he was, beyond question, a crook,
which makes the fact of his having so many
friends all the more remarkable.</p>

<p>“He became well known on the Pacific
coast soon after the war, but it was not until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
’73 or ’74 that he started East, and then
he didn’t come straight through, but stopped
at various places. The first I heard of him
was at Salt Lake City, where he had a notable
adventure. I heard the story from a
man who stood in with him in his faro game
and helped him to get away with considerable
Mormon capital. He traveled with
a faro outfit and dealt a brace game always.
Of course he had to be skilful to do that,
but he was particularly skilful. When he
reached Salt Lake he put up at the Townsend
House and set up his faro layout in his
room, running the game quietly enough to
rouse no antagonism on the part of the landlord,
but managing, with the aid of my informant,
who was an actor, then playing in
Brigham Young’s theatre, to rope in several
of the wildest sports in the city.</p>

<p>“Among others, Brigham Young’s son,
John Young, was informed of the chance to
play, and, being eager to do so, was accommodated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
to the tune of seven hundred or
eight hundred dollars the first night. The
actor went with him and played with him,
and was a loser to a less amount. He was
therefore in a proper position to urge Young
to try it the second night that they might
both get even. Overland Jack, however, let
nobody get even when he was manipulating
the box, and Young lost about three thousand
dollars the second night. He was not
a good loser, as was shown long afterward
when he came to Chicago and killed a man
there in a quarrel in a gambling-house—a
matter, by the way, for which he was never
tried—and he was furious at his losses this
time. Overland Jack was shrewd enough to
foresee trouble, and that night he packed
his faro layout in the trunk of his friend the
actor, and early in the morning started out
for a walk. The walk was a long one, and
not caring about walking back he took a way
train at the next station, and after changing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
cars once or twice was well on his way to
Laramie before John Young went back to
the Townsend House with police force
enough to take in four faro banks and all
their attendants.</p>

<p>“The actor tarried in Salt Lake for a discreet
interval and then went to Laramie himself.
For some reason it was not thought
wise to deal faro there, and they lay around
idle till they got a chance to play together
in a pretty heavy poker game that was going
on. They had not spoken to each other
there till they met at the table, and supposed
that no one in the place knew that
they were acquainted, so the chance seemed
a good one to play in the way they had arranged,
which was for Overland Jack to do
the dealing and the other man to hold the
cards. Among the other players was a rich
plainsman who had come to town for a
racket and was having it to his complete
satisfaction. He was not a particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
good player, and the game looked like a
good thing.</p>

<p>“It came Overland Jack’s deal, and his
confederate looked confidently at his cards,
expecting to find winners, but, instead, he
found nothing at all. Overland Jack had
seen what he had not, that the landlord of
the hotel, who was in the room but not in
the game, was watching the actor’s play, as
if he had an inkling of the truth. Instantly
changing his plan, he dealt himself the hand
he had stacked for the actor, which was four
aces, while he gave the plainsman his four
kings as he had intended.</p>

<p>“There was the raise before the draw and
after it, and the pile on the table grew rapidly,
while the other players dropped out,
and the two hands were being played for all
they were worth. Overland Jack’s nerve
was perfectly good, and he was playing for
the other man’s pile, when he heard a click
under the table, just as the plainsman had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
raised him five hundred dollars. Without
an instant’s hesitation, and without the
slightest change of expression, he exclaimed,
‘That’s good,’ and threw his four
aces into the discard pile. Neither did he
show any emotion of any kind as he saw the
plainsman, with a look of considerable surprise,
rake in the pile. He had cold feet
soon after, however, as did the actor also,
and they left the room and went straight to
the bar.</p>

<p>“While they were chewing their whisky
the landlord and the plainsman came in together,
and Overland Jack instantly called
to them both to come over and have a drink.
They came, and the plainsman put out his
hand, laughing.</p>

<p>“‘You are a good one,’ he said. ‘What
did you throw down four aces for?’</p>

<p>“‘My friend,’ said Overland Jack, ‘when
you have played cards as much as I have you
will know that there are times when four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
aces are not worth four cents. And when
you have been through what I have you will
know that it is damned foolish to pull the
second gun. When you hear a click, and
your own gun is not out, it is time to quit
the game.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, you are a good one,’ said the
plainsman again, and they all drank.</p>

<p>“At that time the old Morton House was
the center of a good deal of the excitement
of various kinds that was going on in this
city, and it was natural enough that Overland
Jack should put up there when he arrived
in New York. He did so, and looked
around quietly enough for a few days without
making himself known. It was not hard
for him to strike up a hotel acquaintance
with Jim Morton, who was then running the
house alone, after Ryan’s death, and it was
not long before Overland Jack managed to
be in the room as a spectator when there
was a tolerably stiff game of poker going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
on. He hadn’t been invited to play, and
he was not making proposals. He was simply
awaiting his chance, and it came suddenly.</p>

<p>“Morton was in the game. So was Shed
Shook, and so were the late General Owens,
Ed Gilmore, and a Senator from Albany
who spent considerable time in the city.
They were betting pretty well and playing
table stakes. Morton was called away by a
summons from the office, and, not caring to
quit the game, he looked around for somebody
to take his hand while he should go
downstairs for a few minutes. It happened
that he saw Overland Jack first among the
lookers-on, and he asked him if he would
keep the seat warm for him.</p>

<p>“Naturally Overland Jack didn’t refuse,
but as he sat down he said: ‘If you want
me to play for you, you’d better leave me
some more money, for I shall play your
cards for all they are worth.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
“Morton had two or three hundred on
the table at the time, but he didn’t hesitate
an instant. Putting his hand in his pocket,
he pulled out a roll and tossed it down in
front of Overland Jack, who did not even
count it, but nodded and shoved the money
all together and waited for his cards. He
never made any charge afterward that anybody
was trying to play tricks in that game,
but he did say that he was satisfied in his
own mind that a certain man in that party
was likely to hold four of a kind soon after
he began playing, and as it happened that
man did hold four deuces the next time it
came Overland Jack’s deal. It was a jack-pot,
and the deuce man opened it for fifty
dollars. The others came in, and Overland
Jack raised it fifty. The deuce man raised
it fifty more, and all stayed.</p>

<p>“On the draw the deuce man called for
one, the next man stood pat on a flush, the
next drew two cards and didn’t fill, the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
drew to two pairs and didn’t better, and the
dealer took three. The opener proceeded
to make merry at his expense. ‘You raised
it on a pair, eh!’ he exclaimed. ‘Well,
you have a nerve, to be sure. Do they play
that kind of poker where you came from?
If they do you have come to a good place to
learn the game. Why, I have you beaten
without a struggle.’ And he shoved one
hundred dollars into the pot.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said Overland Jack, coolly. ‘I
raised it on a pair of queens,’ and he turned
them over, while he let the three he had
drawn lie where they had fallen, without
looking at them himself. ‘A pair of queens
is a good hand to draw to,’ he continued,
speaking with calm indifference to the open
amusement of all the others. ‘There are
more queens in the pack, I suppose, and I
may get some of them.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, you may,’ said the opener, with a
sneer. ‘You may get struck by lightning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
but I’m not looking for it to happen this
evening.’</p>

<p>“The flush man stayed, and the next two
dropped out. Then Overland Jack saw the
hundred and raised it a hundred, still without
looking at his cards.</p>

<p>“The opener skinned through his hand to
make sure that he still had all his deuces,
and then said with paternal severity:
‘Young man, I’m sorry for you, but you certainly
ought to be taught something of the
rudiments of this game. If you are determined
to bet, I’ll give you a chance. I’ll
see your hundred and raise you two hundred
and fifty.’</p>

<p>“It was too rich for the man with a flush,
and he threw down his cards. Then it was
Overland Jack’s turn. He pretended to be
greatly provoked, and said hotly: ‘I may
be a younger man than you are, sir, but
where I came from we call two queens, with
a chance for two more, good for a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
bet, anyhow. So I’ll just cover your two-fifty
and bet you the balance of the pile.’
And he shoved the whole of Morton’s
money to the center of the table, still without
counting it.</p>

<p>“The others were astounded, but he had
made the play and there was only the
opener to talk. He counted the money.
It was eleven hundred and odd dollars.
Then he counted his own. He had only
five hundred with him, and he began to
sputter.</p>

<p>“‘If you’ll take a check,’ he began, but
Overland Jack stopped him.</p>

<p>“‘No checks,’ he said excitedly. ‘This
is table stakes.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, if you’ll wait till I go downstairs
and——’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes,’ sneered Overland Jack.
‘Go out of the room and gather up four of
a kind, I suppose.’</p>

<p>“And there was more talk that resulted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
in the opener getting angry for fair and
calling the bet for the amount of his pile.
He slammed down his four deuces as he did
so and exclaimed: ‘There! Is that good,
or do you think you have drawn the other
two queens?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I don’t know,’ drawled Overland
Jack. ‘Maybe I have. Let’s see,’
and he turned over two queens and an ace.</p>

<p>“Everybody else in the room saw the
point, but the opener was furious. ‘They’re
not good,’ he shouted. ‘You never got that
hand honestly.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes, they’re good,’ said Overland
Jack, with still more of a drawl. ‘Four of
a kind is good—when you get ’em out of the
pack.’</p>

<p>“There was a shout of laughter as the
opener grew purple with rage, and Overland
Jack raked in the pot.</p>

<p>“That was only one of his adventures in
this city. He had a number, and naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
made a good many enemies, but, as in this
case, he made more friends than foes, so
that he was really a popular man despite
the fact that he was known to be a sharper.</p>

<p>“Crooked poker and brace faro were his
favorite games, but he was also a billiard
sharp, who gave pointers as well as points
to the many others of that ilk who made a
living around the billiard saloons in those
days. One of the first places where he distinguished
himself was in Chris Conner’s
place in Fourteenth Street, where there were
always gentlemen of leisure ready to play
almost anybody for a small bet or a large
one, provided they could settle the odds.
Overland Jack always had confederates in
the room ready to make side bets while he
was playing, and he was pretty sure to get
one or two himself in addition to the nominal
stakes of the game. There was one
young fellow who played in Conner’s place
a great deal who really played a marvelous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
game, and was as steady as a rock. Conner
thought he couldn’t be beaten if the odds
were fixed anywhere near right, so Overland
Jack studied his play for a couple of nights
and then sailed in himself.</p>

<p>“He acted the usual part of a fairly skilful
amateur excited with the game and anxious
to display his skill and win or lose his
money, and managed, without trouble, to
get himself picked up as a sucker by this
particular fellow. Conner himself settled
the odds after seeing the stranger play, and
bet considerable money himself on the outside,
but Overland Jack won, hands down.</p>

<p>“In fact, he won at everything he touched
while he was here, but as a matter of course
he soon became known, as a first-class crook
is sure to, and he was obliged after a while to
seek new pastures. So it came that the man
who came and had fun with the New York
sports for a season drifted away again without
exciting any regrets by his departure.”</p>

<h2 id="ch_10">His Last Sunday Game<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>HE WAS BETTING ON A JACK-POT WHEN
THE YACHT UPSET</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p>“The closest call I ever had,” said the
gray-haired young-looking man, “was in a
game of poker, and, curiously enough, nobody
called in that particular deal in which
it occurred. In fact, nobody thought about
it after the interruption until it was too late
for a showdown and the chips had all disappeared,
nobody knew where. It takes a
pretty serious happening to destroy all interest
in a game of poker just at the moment
when somebody has raised the limit in
a big jack-pot and each player is confident
of winning. But this was a serious happening.
It was about the most serious that I
ever knew, and came near being a tragedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
“Perhaps you remember one summer
about ten years ago when a succession of
tremendous squalls struck the south side
of Long Island on four successive Sundays.
I think it was just ten years ago.</p>

<p>“We had a club-house, eight or ten of us,
that summer, which was located on Hicks’s
Beach, on the extreme western end of the
Great South Bay, not far from the Long
Beach Hotel. It was about as unpretentious
as any club-house need be, being only
a shanty, but it was weather-proof, and with
cots and hammocks we made ourselves thoroughly
comfortable when we slept ashore.
More often we would sleep on board the little
sloop yacht that we had chartered for the
summer, for we used to cruise through the
entire day, using the club-house as a rendezvous.
It was one of the jolliest and most
economical seasons I ever enjoyed.</p>

<p>“We all knew something about sailing—I
least of all—but the Commodore, as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
all called him, was the best amateur sailor
I ever knew, so, naturally, we made him
skipper, and nobody else assumed or felt
any responsibility when he was aboard.</p>

<p>“On this particular Sunday, the fourth
in the series of squally Sundays, there were
seven of us on the yacht. We had been
weakfishing all the forenoon about four
miles east of Wreck Lead, and had had fair
luck, but it was wretchedly hot, and, tiring
of the sport, we had run back nearly to
Hicks’s Beach again and come to anchor
off the best bathing-ground in the neighborhood,
opposite the life-saving station.
Then we had a plunge, and after dressing
had gone into the cabin. Two of the men
had gone to sleep and the rest of us had begun
a game of poker. It was the last game
I ever played on Sunday. The Commodore
had made all snug above, and had come
down into the cabin last of all, satisfied
that everything was right, as we were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
in the channel, and no big boats navigate
thereabout anyhow. He was good enough
sailor, however, to leave the game occasionally
for a moment or two, just to take
a look around. But not even he thought it
worth while to keep a lookout all the time,
for he thought we were as safe as we would
have been in a brick house.</p>

<p>“After an hour or so there came a jack-pot,
in which there was some of the most remarkable
drawing I ever saw. The Broker
had opened it on a pair of queens. The
Commodore sat next, and, having a pair of
sevens, came in. The Doctor had three
spades with a queen at the head, and, being
a brash player at all times, pushed in his
chips. I had been having great luck for a
time, and decided to rely on it, so I came
in with an ace. And the Lawyer came also,
though he had only two little four-spots in
his hand. We found out all this long afterward
when we were together one night talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
over the adventure, and at the same time
we learned what the draw was. It seemed
so curious to me that I wrote it down, so I
speak by the card in telling it. The Doctor
was dealing, so I drew the first cards.
They were another ace and three eight spots.
The Lawyer caught another four and two
tens. The Broker got three jacks. The
Commodore caught a seven and two nines,
and the Doctor got his two coveted spades.
A pair of queens was high hand before the
draw, and there were four fulls and a flush
around the board after it. Such a thing
may have happened often, but I never happened
to hear of it as happening on any
other occasion but this.</p>

<p>“Naturally enough, the betting began
furiously, and the chips on the table were
all in the pot presently. We were betting
money and were, some of us, feeling through
our pockets for our rolls, when suddenly the
Commodore threw back his head and raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
his hand with a sudden gesture that arrested
our attention instantly. Dropping his
cards, he sprang to his feet and started to
rush out on deck, when a lurch of the vessel
sent us all sprawling. The squall had
struck us. For a moment, while we were
scrambling up, we could feel the yacht tugging
at her anchor, and then with a sudden
drive dash onward somewhere. Whither we
could not even guess, being all below, but
we afterward found that it was toward the
northeast, the squall coming from the south-west.
Almost at the moment of the snapping
of the cable, for it had snapped, we
heard a tremendous crash overhead, and we
afterward learned that the lurch of the boat
had thrown her stick out of her.</p>

<p>“The sudden drive meant that we were
drifting helplessly toward the mud flats on
the other side of the channel; but before
we could ascertain this—in fact, before any
of us could get to the companion-way—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
wretched boat turned turtle. I have heard
it denied that such a boat could turn turtle
under such circumstances, and I don’t pretend
to explain how or why it did. All I
know is that it did, and it looked as if we
had reached our last quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>“The confusion was indescribable. Of
course we were immediately standing or
scrambling on the ceiling of the little
cabin, while everything that had been on
the floor fell with us. The water rushed in
more than waist deep, and for a few moments
it looked as if the little room would
fill up completely before we could even
think what possibility there was of getting
out. Fortunately, however, there was buoyancy
enough about the miserable craft, and
the cabin was deep enough in the hull, to
keep it pretty near the water level, and the
air in the room was not immediately displaced.
At least that was how I reasoned it
out. All that I can say positively is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
whereas I expected to be totally submerged
I found that I could easily enough keep my
head out of water. What air there was in
the cabin doubtless helped to keep us afloat,
confined as it was, and for a time—it seemed
a very long time—we were tossed about,
splashed, and thrown down, as the boat
rocked and pitched, but we were not
drowned.</p>

<p>“At first no one spoke. The situation
was too awful for words, and it seemed as if
we were all so shocked as to be mentally
stunned. I know I was for one, and if our
escape had depended on my thinking of a
means we would all have perished then and
there. Fortunately the Commodore grasped
the situation, and, as we could talk and understand
one another well enough, he told
us his plan in a few words. It was simple,
and it gave us at least a chance for life.
Moreover, it appeared to be our only
chance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
“‘You can all swim,’ he said. ‘Find
a fishing-line. There are plenty in the
cabin.’</p>

<p>“Somebody produced one in a moment.
It was on a reel.</p>

<p>“‘Hold fast to the reel,’ said the Commodore.
‘I’ll take one end of the line and
dive through the companion-way. I think
I can find my way over the side and up on
the bottom of the boat. I’ll hold my end,
and when you feel three jerks make this end
fast. Then you will have to follow, one at
a time. Don’t let go of the line as you go
out, and you can’t miss the way. I’ll hold
the other end.’</p>

<p>“‘Very good, Commodore,’ said the
Broker, ‘but I’d better go first. You know
what a swimmer I am, and I reckon the man
who goes first will have the hardest job.’</p>

<p>“The Commodore was disposed to dispute
this proposition, but the Lawyer spoke
up sharply: ‘Let him go, Commodore,’ he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
said. ‘It’s a forlorn hope at best, and he’s
far and away the best swimmer.’ So it was
settled, and in another moment the Broker
had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all the story. The plan
worked and we were all perched on the keel
inside of ten minutes. There we were seen
by the life-saving patrol, and were all taken
off safely soon after. I can’t say I ever enjoyed
yachting after that day, and, as I said,
I never played poker on Sunday again.”</p>

<h2 id="ch_11">Foss Stopped the Game<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>ONE OF THE DUTIES OF AN OLD-TIME MISSISSIPPI
RIVER PACKET CAPTAIN</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p>“I have always been a little hazy in my
notion of what are the proper functions of
the Captain of a Mississippi River steamboat,”
said the gray-haired young-looking
man. “I suppose, really, that nothing
would have been easier than for me to find
out, for I traveled a great deal on the river
some years ago, and I knew a lot of people
who were engaged in steamboating as a
business, besides enjoying a personal acquaintance
with several of the Captains
themselves. But there are some things that
I do not like to know definitely, and this
is one of them. It is more interesting to
speculate about them in idle moments and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
to think of all sorts of whimsicalities as
possible than to get at the facts, which
would not be interesting at all.</p>

<p>“Now, on the lakes, and on such salt-water
craft as I have traveled on, the Captain
of the boat is very much in evidence.
He has all to say about everything, and
seems to be a sort of court of appeals for
the trial and final disposition of all cases,
trivial or important. He seems to have a
personal supervision over every detail of his
business, and to have very little real leisure.
It may be, of course, that the Captain
of a Mississippi boat has similar duties
and responsibilities, but it doesn’t seem so
to the average passenger.</p>

<p>“In the first place, he seems to have
nothing to say about the navigation of his
boat. The pilot attends to that, apparently,
all the time. Then the Captain has
little to say to the crew. The mate bosses
the deckhands and the roustabouts, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
engineer has control of his own department.
I suppose the Captain gives them both orders,
though I never saw or heard him do it.
I have heard him order the waiters about in
the dining-room, but it seems ridiculous to
class that among his duties. Altogether, to
one who doesn’t understand the matter, the
Captain’s office seems suited to comic opera
rather than to navigation, and, as I intimated,
I enjoy comic opera too much to
want to understand this.</p>

<p>“There is one thing about the position,
however, which is no joke. The Captain
has arbitrary police power over everybody
on board his boat, unless, indeed, the pilot
is exempt. I don’t know about that. So
well is this fact understood that I never saw
this authority disputed but once, and on
that occasion it was not well for the man
who did the disputing.</p>

<p>“Captain Foss of the river packet Lone
Star, plying between St. Louis and New Orleans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
some twenty years ago, was one of the
finest men I ever chanced to know on the
river. That he was a Southerner no one
could doubt who saw him and heard him
talk, but I never knew what State he came
from. He was a man of middle stature and
remarkable physical development, strong as
a horse and active as a cat. I think he had
been in the army, for he had a military
bearing, but his title of Captain came, of
course, from his position. He was somewhat
of a dandy, and dressed in what was
old style even then, but the exquisite neatness
and fine material of his clothing made
him conspicuous even among the wealthy
and well-dressed passengers who patronized
his boat from choice whenever they traveled
the river.</p>

<p>“Suave, polished, and extremely quiet in
his manners on ordinary occasion, he could
blaze out in the most fiery bursts of temper
when he had provocation. I never saw him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
in a temper but twice, and curiously enough
the trouble grew out of a game of poker
each time.</p>

<p>“Poker was always played in the main
saloon of the boat at night, as a matter of
course, and I have seen some stiff games
played on the Lone Star, for I made several
trips on her. I didn’t hesitate to play there
myself, even with strangers, for I knew the
reputation of the boat and of the Captain,
who played himself occasionally, though not
very often. He was called one of the best
players on the river, and was known to be
thoroughly upright and believed to be utterly
devoid of fear. He knew all the gamblers
who traveled the river, and would not
allow any crooked play in his jurisdiction.
It was reported that they all knew this and
had a wholesome respect for his authority,
knowing that he made it a rule to set a man
ashore in the wilderness if he was detected
in any underhand work. He had done this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
several times, and it was generally believed
that there wasn’t a gambler in the country
who would play any tricks on Captain Foss’s
boat.</p>

<p>“One night, an hour or two after we had
left Memphis on the way down the river,
the Captain sauntered into the saloon looking
as if he hadn’t a care or a responsibility
of any kind, and, seeing a game of cards
going on, he walked up to the table and
joined the lookers-on, of whom I was one.
It was a fairly stiff game, and there was
enough money changing hands to make it
rather exciting, even for those who weren’t
playing. As for the four men who were playing,
they seemed almost dead to the outside
world. Whether they were playing beyond
their means, or whether it was simply the excitement
of the game that held them spellbound,
I didn’t know, but I had watched
them for an hour and hadn’t heard one of
them utter a word beyond what the game<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
called for. Their faces all showed intense
emotion, and one man’s hand shook so that
he had hard work to deal. It may not have
been the game that caused it, but I thought
it was.</p>

<p>“After Captain Foss had been standing
by for a few minutes, one of the four, a
pale, intellectual-looking man, threw down
a losing hand with some show of temper,
and exclaimed with an oath, ‘not loud, but
deep’: ‘I never did have any luck in a
four-handed game.’ And looking around
the little group—there were a dozen or
more of us—he spied the Captain.</p>

<p>“‘Captain,’ he said, ‘won’t you take a
hand?’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said Captain Foss, ‘I don’t
mind playing a little while if none of the
other gentlemen object. I didn’t know you
were superstitious, though, Dr. Baisley.’</p>

<p>“The doctor frowned. ‘I guess everybody
is who plays cards,’ he replied shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
“‘Possibly,’ said Captain Foss; and as
the other three signified a welcome to him,
he drew up a chair and bought some chips.</p>

<p>“It was a curious thing, and to Dr. Baisley
it was, no doubt, ‘confirmation strong
as proofs of Holy Writ’ of his superstition,
but it is a fact that his luck turned from the
moment Captain Foss entered the game.
He had been a heavy loser before. I could
count up over a thousand dollars in chips
that I had seen him lose, and I hadn’t seen
all the play. But the turn set the chips
rolling back to him so fast that he was soon
even and then winner to a considerable
amount.</p>

<p>“Of the others, one was evidently a commercial
traveler who had got into a heavier
game than knights of the road often indulge
in. Somehow, he did not seem like a gentleman,
and I was not greatly surprised
when he lost his temper, for his luck had
changed also. He had been the largest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
winner at first, for the other two won and
lost in turn, so that they were not far from
even. But as the doctor won, he lost, until
at length he pulled out what seemed to
be his last hundred-dollar bill and bought
another stack of chips.</p>

<p>“These, too, he was losing when the doctor
beat his flush with a full. Throwing
down his cards, he said, with a nasty sneer:
‘It’s evident that you knew who to invite
into the game.’</p>

<p>“There was a hush for a moment. Everybody
seemed to be holding his breath. We
all looked at Captain Foss, and I don’t
think anybody would have been surprised to
see him draw a weapon. The insult was a
frightful one, and, as I said, the Captain
could blaze on occasions.</p>

<p>“He blazed this time. There was no
motion toward physical violence, but he
glared at the fellow as an angry tiger might
have glared, and the veins stood out in uneven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
knots on his forehead, and his clenched
fists quivered in the struggle for self-control.
At first he could not speak for rage, but
presently he swallowed spasmodically twice,
and then broke forth.</p>

<p>“‘If I could lower myself and forget my
place so far as to meet such a vile whelp of
a hell-hound as you on common ground, I’d
cut your ears off and make you eat them
along with your words. As it is, damn
you—’ And then he went on with such a
torrent of profane abuse as I for one never
heard before or since. The wretch actually
cowered under it like a whipped dog. He
tried to speak once or twice, but he might
as well have tried to whistle down a whirlwind,
and presently realizing his miserable
impotence, he shoved the balance of his
chips over to the banker, who cashed them,
and slunk away to his stateroom.</p>

<p>“Captain Foss sat talking, or raving,
whichever it was, till the fellow’s door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
closed. Then he stopped, and we could
see that he was again struggling to control
himself. There was another hush, which
was presently broken by a young fellow less
than twenty years old, who had been listening
open-mouthed.</p>

<p>“‘My!’ he exclaimed. ‘But that was
fine.’</p>

<p>“This brought a general burst of laughter,
in which the Captain himself joined
after a few moments, and the strain was
over. But I don’t think there was a man
there who would not rather have been shot
at than to have had such a tongue-lashing.</p>

<p>“The fact of the Captain of a passenger
boat playing poker in the cabin when actually
in command of her, and in active
service, was, I think, what set me thinking,
as I said, about his duties and responsibilities.
It seemed a strange thing to me
then, because it was the first time I ever
saw it. But, though the strangeness wore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
off afterward when I saw other Captains
doing the same thing, I never saw Foss play
again, though I believe he occasionally did
so.</p>

<p>“I noticed, however, every time I traveled
with him after that, that he always
came into the saloon in the evening and
looked at the play that was going on. And
on one occasion I got an inkling of his reasons
for doing this. It was a part of his
regular patrol of the boat, and he was as
particular to see that nothing was going
wrong at the card table as he was to see
that everything was right elsewhere on the
boat. Of course, poker itself was not considered
wrong. It was part of the regular
routine of life. A man could play or not,
but a man who would object to anybody
else playing would have been as lonesome
as a prohibitionist in Kentucky.</p>

<p>“Drinking was common on the river
boats. Drunkenness was rare. If there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
were ladies among the passengers, as commonly
there were, drinks were seldom
served in the main saloon till after they
had retired. Then, if a man wanted a
drink while he was playing, one of the
darkies would bring it to him.</p>

<p>“On the particular occasion that I speak
of a man not over twenty-two or twenty-three
years old was playing cards at a table
with four older men. He was a bright,
handsome fellow, with manly ways and a
pleasant manner, who seemed well able to
take care of himself even at poker, and
who, indeed, held his own fairly well in the
first part of the game. The play went on,
however, far into the night, and a number
of drinks were brought to the table, so that
after a time the youngster grew flushed and
began playing wild.</p>

<p>“Captain Foss noticed this, as he noticed
everything, but did not at once interfere.
I observed, however, that he passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
in and out several times between the saloon
and the deck, and just as I had seen a particularly
foolish play made by the youngster
I heard the Captain say quietly: ‘Gentlemen,
the game will have to be closed for
to-night.’</p>

<p>“Naturally the players all looked up in
surprise, and one or two attempted a remonstrance,
but, noticing the Captain’s expression,
thought better of it. He was
smiling pleasantly, but you could tell by
his face that he was in earnest.</p>

<p>“The youngster himself was vehement
and vociferous, but the Captain only smiled
at him still more pleasantly, and said again
that the game must be closed for the night.
It was easy enough to manage such a case as
his, but after the young fellow had pleaded
and sputtered and even tried feebly to bluster
without any success, another man, much
older, of dark visage and thin, sharp features,
spoke up in ugly fashion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
“‘I call it a piece of impertinence and
a gross assumption of authority for the Captain
of a steamboat or anybody else to undertake
to stop a party of gentlemen playing
a friendly game.’</p>

<p>“A quick change came over the Captain’s
face. The smile was gone, and the
eyes contracted a little as they seemed to
shoot fire, so keen and brilliant was the
look in them:</p>

<p>“‘It is not necessary, Major, to consider
what I might or might not do in case a
party of gentlemen were playing a friendly
game of poker here. The point is that this
game is going to stop now. Gentlemen
don’t ply boys with liquor and then win
money from them, and, by the Almighty,
nobody else is going to do it on my boat.’</p>

<p>“The Major was as angry now as the Captain.
He glanced at the other players, but
they all had sufficient grace to be ashamed,
or, at least, to appear so, and with a contemptuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
smile, he said: ‘I understand
you perfectly, Captain, and I suppose you
will give me satisfaction. Nobody else
seems inclined to demand it, but I am not
in the habit of allowing anybody to lie
about me without calling him to account.’</p>

<p>“No law on earth could have prevented
those two men from fighting after that, and
there was nobody present to put the machinery
of the law in operation, even if it
had been of any avail. The Captain bowed.
‘I will make a landing on the Arkansas side
in twenty minutes,’ he said, ‘and we can
step ashore alone, unless you prefer to take
a friend with you.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said the Major, ‘I would rather
prefer going alone.’</p>

<p>“The two saluted and the Captain strode
out of the cabin. The Major, without
deigning a look or a word to any of us,
walked over to his stateroom, entered it,
and closed the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
“There was a good deal of quiet conversation
going on for a little while, but nobody
seemed to feel called on—I know I
did not—to interfere, and there was considerable
speculation as to which would kill
the other. That one of them would be
killed seemed certain, and, it was my own
notion that the Major would be the one.
It was true that I did not know him, but I
did know Captain Foss.</p>

<p>“I was right. When the boat slackened
speed and then slid her nose into the mud,
stopping with that queer, slow suddenness
with which a boat does stop on a bank, we
all went outside to see the two men off. I
was surprised to see that it was daylight, for
I had not thought it was so late. But, looking
around, I saw the pilot had chosen an
excellent spot for the purpose in hand. He
had run so close to a wooded knoll in the
forest that it was easy to put a gangplank
out to reach the firm ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
“As he stepped toward this gangplank
Captain Foss paused, and, addressing the
mate, said, so that we could all understand
him, ‘Do not allow any one to go ashore for
half an hour after I do. If neither I nor
Major Nevins should return in that time,
take four men and come after us.’ Then
he turned to Major Nevins, who was close
beside him, and said something to him
which no one else could hear. The Major
nodded, and the two stepped ashore together.</p>

<p>“Walking side by side, they disappeared
among the trees. Almost breathlessly, it
seemed to me, we all listened for a long
time. I don’t know how long, though I
noticed the mate kept his watch in his
hand. Suddenly we heard two shots, almost
together. Then there was a pause,
then another shot, then another, then
silence.</p>

<p>“Three or four minutes after this we saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Captain Foss walking back alone toward the
boat. Coming on board, he stopped beside
the mate and gave him some orders in an
undertone, then passed on to his own room.
The mate saluted, and, calling two men to
him, went somewhere aft, presently returning
with a folded cloth in his hand which
looked like a sheet. The two men brought
a cot with them, and, following the mate
with two more men, to whom he called, they
went ashore and disappeared in the woods.</p>

<p>“When they returned, some quarter of an
hour later, there was a burden on the cot,
which all four men were carrying, and over
this burden the sheet was spread, decently
and smoothly. It was carried to Major
Nevins’s room and deposited inside. Then
the door was locked and the key taken to
the Captain’s room.</p>

<p>“The boat moved on, and when we
reached Helena, which was the next stopping-place,
Captain Foss went ashore alone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
In an hour’s time he returned to the boat
with the Coroner of the town, the local undertaker,
and two or three of his assistants.
The burden on the cot was taken ashore,
and after a little time the boat went on
down the river.</p>

<p>“If there was ever any prosecution I
didn’t hear of it. All I know is that it was
then the custom in Arkansas to allow the
survivor to go on his own recognizance in
any case in which the Coroner was satisfied
that there had been a fair fight.”</p>

<p>“For my sins, I suppose it must have
been, I lived once in Egypt,” said the
gray-haired young-looking man in the club
smoking-room, “and if Egypt on the other
side of the world is anything like the southern
part of Illinois, I can readily understand
how the children of Israel found the wilderness
preferable. As I remember the story,
though, in Pharaoh’s realm they had only
one plague at a time, whereas in southern
Illinois—however, there may be a better
condition of things there now, so there’s
nothing to gain by recalling our experiences.
I sincerely hope things are better,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
but I scarcely think I have curiosity enough
to go back and find out.</p>

<p>“In our village—for I was a part of it,
and a part of it was mine—about the same
conditions obtained as in all the other small
settlements within a hundred miles. We
had a railroad station and two trains a day.
We had a post-office and one mail a day.
We had a general store and a blacksmith’s
shop and a tavern, and we had a few private
residences. If there was anything else of
importance, excepting the farmers’ wagons,
that came in with loads that were too heavy
for the horses, and too often went back with
loads that burdened the farmers, the details
have escaped my mind. It was a typical
southern Illinois village.</p>

<p>“Small as it was, there were two social
sets in town. The married men lived in
their own houses, and their wives visited
one another and had their small festivities
from time to time in the most serene indifference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
to the fact that there were other human
beings around. And these others—that
is, the unmarried men—lived at the
tavern, or hotel, as we preferred to call it,
equally indifferent to the occurrence of social
functions to which we were not bidden.
If, as occasionally happened, one of the
married men broke loose for a night or two,
and spent his spare time and money at the
hotel, he was tolerated, but no more. We
felt sorry for him when we thought of his
return home, but we had no yearnings toward
reciprocity in his effort to break down
the barriers.</p>

<p>“In our set there was, it is true, one
married woman, but she did not count. At
least we thought so till the trouble came.
She was the landlord’s wife. Old Stein, as
we called him, though he was not over forty,
was a placid, easy-going German, who kept
the hotel fairly up to the standard of the
country, and I think a trifle above it, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
hadn’t energy enough, apparently, to make
any strenuous effort to improve things.
What was good enough for his boarders was
good enough for him, and we were demoralized
enough by the climate, or whatever it
is that tends to the deterioration of mankind
thereabout, to make no demand for
unusual luxury. As far as we ever noticed,
he had no remarkable affection for his wife,
but seemed rather too indifferent to her very
pronounced hunger for admiration.</p>

<p>“She was a born flirt, but though she carried
her flirtations with anybody who would
flirt with her, much nearer to the danger line
than would be tolerated in a more strait-laced
community, it was the general opinion
among the boarders that there was no real
evil in her, and, moreover, that she was
fully capable of taking care of herself in
almost any emergency. So, though she
would not have been recognized as respectable
by any other married woman in town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
a fact that troubled her not, she was considered
all right by our set, and we looked
upon her as a good fellow rather than as a
woman bound by the ordinary rules of propriety.
She was a German by descent, and
Stein was German by birth, but Lena was
perhaps too thoroughly Americanized in a
poor school.</p>

<p>“Naturally trouble came of it. We were
accustomed, as the people in most small
Western towns were accustomed some years
ago, to receiving occasionally a visit from
what we used to call a ‘cross-roads gambler.’
These worthies are perhaps the least
useful and most ‘ornery’ specimens of humanity
to be found in North America.
They are professionals without the skill or
nerve they need to enable them to hold their
own among other professionals. Knowing
just enough to cheat, but not enough to
cheat deftly, they travel about the country,
usually alone, but sometimes in pairs, stopping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
in the smallest settlements for a day or
a week at a time, looking for victims. No
game is too small for them, though they
will play heavily at times, but they manage
to live on their little skill by worming their
way into friendly games of poker, such as
are played all over the country, but perhaps
more openly in the West than in the East.</p>

<p>“When Dick Bradley happened along our
way and stopped over at our town, we had,
though we did not realize it immediately,
all the elements of a drama right at hand.
It was not long before the drama was enacted,
and perhaps it was just as well that
we were not a little farther West, for there
might have been considerable shooting in
the last act. As it was we had a duel, but
that was fought with the pasteboards instead
of revolvers, and the difference was supposed
to be settled by a freeze-out in the
great American game.</p>

<p>“Bradley was an ordinary cross-roads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
gambler, and nothing more. He was a little
handsomer than the usual run of men,
and he dressed rather better than custom
demanded in that part of the country.
Moreover, he had a free-and-easy way with
him—it was a part of his stock in trade—that
was attractive to anybody, and I suppose
especially so to a woman like Lena.
At all events he hadn’t been with us twenty-four
hours before there was a violent flirtation
going on between the two. We all
considered that natural enough, and supposing
we knew the woman thoroughly
well, we thought no harm of it at first.
Stein took no notice of it apparently, and
as it was a matter that concerned no one
else so closely as it did him, none of us felt
called on to say anything.</p>

<p>“Somewhat to our surprise, however,
Bradley stayed on for more than a week.
It wasn’t his regular business that kept him,
for though we played poker every night, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
a matter of course, in the back room of the
hotel, and though he got into the game,
equally as a matter of course, he didn’t
make enough out of it to make it an object
to stay. There were some of us who understood
the game and the ordinary tricks of
crooked players as well as he did, and he
was not long in finding out that he had to
play square if he played at all. So, as we
never played for big money, the prospect
was a poor one for him. Still he stayed.
After a few days we all, excepting Stein,
began to see that he was staying entirely on
Lena’s account. He was a bit cautious at
first; more so than she was, but seeing that
Stein made no objection to anything she
did, but gave her a perfectly free foot, the
gambler grew bolder and bolder, until there
was no longer any possibility of remaining
blind to the fact that a scandal impended.
Some of us talked it over very quietly and
carefully, but it was agreed that no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
ought to interfere, since Stein did not see fit
to do so.</p>

<p>“We had begun to think that Stein was
absolutely indifferent and to regard him
with considerable contempt, when one
evening he undeceived us, and gave us a
great surprise by his manner of doing it. It
was early in the evening, and, though we
had gathered—perhaps a dozen of us—in
the card-room, we had not yet begun playing
when Stein came in, and, after fidgeting
around for a minute or two in a manner
quite unlike his usual phlegmatic way, spoke
suddenly to Bradley.</p>

<p>“‘Look here, Bradley,’ he said in his
broken English, ‘I must settle things with
you. I have talked things with my wife,
Lena, already, and she says she will go
away with you. If she goes this world is no
good to me any more, and you and I must
settle if she goes or if she stays. I would
kill you, but it would be foolishness to try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
that, for I am not a fighting man and you
always carry your gun. Now, what shall we
do? Will you go away and leave me my
Lena, or will she go with you?’</p>

<p>“The poor Dutchman seemed not to understand
in the least what an amazing sort
of a speech this was. His voice trembled
with his strong emotion, and there were tears
in his eyes. The rest of us were struck
dumb. I don’t know what the other fellows
thought, but I know that there came to me
a sort of hungry longing to organize a tar-and-feather
party, with Dick Bradley as the
principal guest. And, despite my contemptuous
pity for the husband who showed so
little manhood, I made up my mind that
there was going to be fair play, anyhow.</p>

<p>“Bradley was fairly staggered. He
flushed and stammered, and, I think, was
for a moment about to say that he would
go; but he pulled himself together, and
seemed to remember that as a bad man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
he had a reputation to sustain. At length
he said:</p>

<p>“‘It’s pretty hard to tell what to do,
Stein. I’d be willing to fight you for the
woman if you wanted to do that, but, as
you don’t, I suppose she’d better settle it
herself.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said the landlord. ‘She is foolish
with you now, and she would have no
sense about it. You and I will settle it
now. And what will you do? Will you
go away and leave us?’</p>

<p>“Bradley looked around, as if to see
what the crowd thought about it, and perceiving
at a glance that our sympathies were
all with the other man, he replied:</p>

<p>“‘Well, if you won’t fight, supposing we
settle it with the cards. I’ll play you a
freeze-out, $1,000 against your wife. What
do you say?’</p>

<p>“‘I say no,’ said Stein again, and we
began almost to respect him. ‘I will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
play my wife against your money, but I will
play you a freeze-out for $1,000, my money
against yours, and if you lose, you will go
away. And if I lose, I will go away, and
she may do what she likes. Only you will
play a square game.’</p>

<p>“‘You bet, by ——, it’ll be a square
game,’ said Jack Peters, the biggest man
and the best card player in the party. ‘I
don’t like your proposition, but that’s your
business and not mine. But if you’re
going to play, Stein, you may be perfectly
sure that Bradley won’t try any cross-roads
tricks in this freeze-out.’</p>

<p>“Bradley seated himself at the card table
and said: ‘Get out your cards.’ At the
same time he pulled out his wad and counted
off the thousand. Stein got the cards and
chips, and each man taking chips to represent
his pile, the money was laid at one
side. It did not seem like an even contest,
for Stein was not a good player. I was delighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
to notice, however, after they were
fairly well going, that Stein was the cooler
of the two. Bradley, I suppose, was a bit
rattled by the consciousness that we were
watching his play suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Bradley tried at first to force the play,
and once or twice caught Stein for considerable
money, but the game went on for
perhaps twenty minutes without anything
like a decisive result. Suddenly, as Stein
was about to cut the cards, Jack Peters exclaimed:</p>

<p>“‘Shuffle ’em, Stein!’</p>

<p>“‘Can’t Stein play his own game?’
asked Bradley.</p>

<p>“‘I reckon he can,’ said Peters, ‘but in
case the cards should happen to be stacked
against him, and I found it out, there’d be
a lynching right here in this town to-night.
I don’t want that to happen, so I thought
I’d make sure.’</p>

<p>“It was an unfair trick, for Bradley had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
not stacked the cards. He hadn’t dared to.
But Peters told me afterward that he did
it to ‘throw a scare’ into Bradley if he
could. He succeeded, for the gambler lost
his nerve when he looked around once more,
while Stein remained as cool as before. He
nodded and shuffled the cards and the game
went on.</p>

<p>“The end came suddenly. It was a flush
against a full, and Stein held the full and
swept the board. There was a moment’s
silence, and then Bradley said with a short
laugh:</p>

<p>“‘Well, I’ve lost, and I’ll leave town
on the morning train. That’ll do, I suppose,
won’t it?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, that’ll do,’ said Stein, gravely.
He had won in the outrageous contest, and
I expected to see him greatly elated, but
instead he seemed curiously depressed.
And as the situation was decidedly embarrassing
for all hands we went to bed uncommonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
early that night, so that everybody
was up in time next morning to see Bradley
go on the early train as he had agreed to
do.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” said the gray-haired young-looking
man, in answer to a question,
“that is the end of the story, as far as the
poker part of it goes. Of course there was
this sequel. It was inevitable, I suppose.
Lena followed Bradley a day or two afterward,
and Stein drank himself to death.”</p>

<h2 id="ch_13">The Club’s Last Game<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>IT TAUGHT AN INTERESTING MORAL ABOUT
RAISING THE LIMIT</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p>“It is sometimes hard to draw the line
between a professional gambler and another,”
said the gray-haired young-looking
man in the club smoking-room. “And
even if you do succeed in making the distinction
clear, the comparison isn’t always
to the detriment of the professional. I remember
an instance in a poker club to
which I once belonged, which was interesting
enough, though it pointed no particular
moral that I know of, unless it was by renewing
the old doubt whether the devil is
always as black as he is painted.</p>

<p>“Our club was rather a curious one in
some respects, though we did not realize it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
at the time. It began with a little game in
one of the New England cities where you
have to keep very quiet about your card
playing unless you don’t give a rap for your
standing in the business community, to say
nothing of your social position. I don’t
know that people are so very much better in
such communities than they are elsewhere,
but there is a sort of general bluff made by
common consent that shuts out open and
flagrant offenders from companionship with
those who have more regard for ‘the speech
of people.’</p>

<p>“There were six of us in the party that
used to meet every Saturday night at one another’s
rooms, and it was as pleasant and harmonious
a circle as I ever joined. We were
all young business men, unmarried and prosperous,
and all of excellent standing at that
time. There was never a quarrel among us,
in all our play, and for a long time the play
was never heavy enough to hurt even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
worst loser. It was almost always a fifty-cent
limit, though we would often disregard
the limit in the single round of consolation
jack-pots with which we concluded every
evening’s play.</p>

<p>“One of the number, whom I will call
George, for I can’t give surnames in this
story, because it is a true one, was transferred
by the railroad company for which
he worked to another city, forty odd miles
away. Then Harry had an offer of a situation
in a large wholesale house in another
direction, and sold out his business to accept
it. Eli married a rich girl in still
another place, and he moved away, leaving
only three of us in the same town, yet the
Saturday evening games went on almost
without interruption. Eli was, naturally
enough, oftenest absent, but George and
Harry would come in by rail, so that we
always had four and almost always five at
the table. Of course, as the old friendship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
was as warm as ever, we enjoyed the reunions
even more keenly than we had.
After a time the play grew harder. The
limit was usually $2, and occasionally as
high as $5, while it was lifted off altogether
in the consolation pots, so that it was not
unusual for one or two of us to be several
hundred dollars ahead or behind at the end
of the evening.</p>

<p>“Things went on this way for perhaps a
couple of years before the smash came, and
while some of us were not specially harmed
by it, there is no doubt that our club did
work serious mischief to at least two of the
party. We didn’t know about it until
afterward, but it was true that Harry had
become so infatuated with cards that he had
neglected his business and had lost his situation
in the wholesale house, and then,
instead of trying to get employment elsewhere,
had devoted himself entirely to
gambling, and had become a full-fledged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
professional. None of us had happened to
learn of his discharge, and as he said nothing
to us about it, we never suspected the truth
till we learned it very strangely. He continued
meeting with us, as usual, and in
our company, at least, he never played anything
but a straight game.</p>

<p>“As for George, we did know that he was
playing a great deal, aside from his games
with us, for he told us about it and we knew
to our sorrow that he was particularly unlucky.
He had some means, outside of his
very good salary, so we didn’t suspect that
he was financially involved. We did know,
however, that he played in the heaviest
games he could get into, and on more than
one occasion he traveled two or three hundred
miles in order to sit in at some game
that he would hear of, where the stakes
were likely to be unusually large. The
railroad company kept him on the go a good
part of the time, so he was able to manage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
this without really neglecting his work, and
if the officials of the road had learned of his
gambling habits they either underestimated
the importance of them or they valued
George’s services very highly, for he was
promoted, not once, but two or three times.
We therefore had a professional among us
without knowing it, and another man who
was playing further beyond his limit than we
dreamed of, and still our little game went
on, as pleasantly and serenely as if we were
not drifting into a tragedy.</p>

<p>“One particular summer night we had a
full table. Each one of the six was there,
and all seemed unusually gay. The game
was a good one, too, for the cards ran high
and the luck ran from one to the other
most delightfully. We started with the usual
two-dollar limit, but it was broken two or
three times without any remonstrance, so
that after a couple of hours we were playing
without any limit. Bets of $10 and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
$20 were made frequently, and several times
there was $100 in a jack-pot before cards
were drawn.</p>

<p>“Eli had to go home by a train that went
through about 1:30 o’clock, so the consolation
pots were played a little before one.
We had been playing about four hours then,
and the luck had been running against
George for half an hour. It was affecting
him, too, and instead of waiting for a turn
he had been trying to force it, so that he
was considerably dipped, and I for one was
hoping that he would recoup in one or two
pots in the last round. He didn’t, though.
On the contrary, he came into each of the
first five, standing all the raises before the
draw, and drawing to one card, on the
chance of getting an accidental hand. It
was wretchedly poor play, of course, but
he was trying desperately to force the luck.</p>

<p>“On the last deal I thought he had a
chance, for he opened the pot for $20. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
had gone around for three or four deals, so
it was a good pot to start with, and after it
was opened it grew rapidly. We all came
in, and Harry raised it ten. George went
back at him with twenty more, and we all
came in.</p>

<p>“On the draw George took two cards,
Harry two, and Eli one. The rest of us
took three each, but as none of us bettered
his pair, we dropped our cards, leaving the
three to fight it out. George bet fifty, and
Eli, who sat next, raised it fifty. Harry
came in and raised it ten. It looked a
little queer, but I remembered then that
Harry had been playing more moderately
than any of the rest of us all the evening.
George put up fifty more, and Eli made
good. He had filled a small flush, but
sitting between two raisers he didn’t care
to play too hard on it. Harry raised it ten
again, and George showed his excitement
plainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
“‘A hundred better,’ he almost shouted,
putting up the money.</p>

<p>“Eli laid his hand on the table, but
Harry put up a hundred and ten.</p>

<p>“‘Another hundred,’ said George, now
fairly trembling.</p>

<p>“‘Ten more,’ said Harry, as cool as ever.</p>

<p>“‘Five hundred better,’ exclaimed
George.</p>

<p>“‘Ten more.’</p>

<p>“‘A thousand better,’ said George, and
Harry hesitated.</p>

<p>“‘I have you beaten, George,’ he said,
after a moment, ‘but I don’t want to play
any higher. This is getting altogether too
heavy for our party. I’ll call you.’</p>

<p>“‘It isn’t too heavy for me,’ said George,
almost insultingly. ‘I’ll go you another
thousand on my hand if you will stand it.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said Harry, still as cool as possible.
‘I won’t go any higher. I have called
you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
“George laid down an ace full, and
looked with confident expectation to see
Harry surrender, but instead he showed
down four eights. ‘I was pretty sure,’ he
said quietly.</p>

<p>“George’s face turned white, and we all
saw that he was hard hit, though we didn’t
suspect even then that it was so serious as it
was.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll have to give you a check for that
last thousand,’ he said, faltering, for he had
not put up the money on the last bet. We
had always settled up before separating at
night, but it was not unusual for checks to
pass among us, though we had never had so
much money up before.</p>

<p>“‘That’s all right,’ said Harry, and to
my surprise his voice trembled when he
spoke. ‘The fact is,’ he continued after he
had swallowed once or twice in the effort to
get control of himself—‘the fact is, I’m not
going to take your money, George. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
been playing this game for fun, and I don’t
think I was doing you fellows any harm by
playing with you, for I have always played
square, and I’ve never taken any of your
money to speak of; but the fact is, I have
been a professional gambler for a year past,
and I have been sailing under false colors.
I don’t say that I wouldn’t do that anywhere
else, but I wouldn’t do it among my
old friends. Take back your money,
George. I don’t believe you can afford to
lose it, and I wouldn’t take it if you could.’</p>

<p>“This was sufficiently surprising, but
what George said was even more so, to the
rest of us, for we knew that he wasn’t above
playing with professionals elsewhere.</p>

<p>“‘I wouldn’t take it back,’ he said with
a sneer, ‘if the game had been above board,
but if, as you say, you have been sailing
under false colors, I think I can take it
without any loss of self-respect.’ And he
pocketed the money which Harry pushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
over to him, after deducting what he himself
had put in.</p>

<p>“It was the last game we ever played together,
and we broke up with a feeling of
constraint that we had never had before.
Our good-nights were said in the usual
words, but the tone was that of curious embarrassment.
We could not feel the same
toward either of the two, but I think we all
felt far more respect for Harry than we did
for George.</p>

<p>“I am quite sure we all did after we read
in the papers two weeks later that George
had absconded with a considerable amount
of the company’s money. It appeared
from the published accounts that he had
been a defaulter for some months, though
he had concealed the fact by falsifying his
books, so that he was really playing with
stolen money when he pretended a superiority
to Harry.</p>

<p>“I never saw either of the two men again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
and as I tell you, we never had another
meeting of the club. As for me, I have
never played poker since for any considerable
stakes. When the game gets so large
that it is a question of money instead of the
fun of the game itself, I always drop out.”</p>

from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
